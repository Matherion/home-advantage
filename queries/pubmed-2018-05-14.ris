TI  - Trends in aggressive play and refereeing among the top five European soccer
      leagues.
PG  - 1346-1354
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2017.1377911 [doi]
AB  - Current trends suggest professional soccer is becoming less aggressive, with
      England often argued to have the most aggressive of the top European leagues. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate differences in fouls and cards as
      indicators of aggressive play in the first divisions of England, France, Germany,
      Italy, and Spain over the past decade. Number of fouls per match and per yellow
      card has decreased in all leagues since 2007/08, though attempted tackles per
      foul has not changed or has increased. A lack of substantial rule changes
      suggests players have become less aggressive in tackling as opposed to referees
      becoming more lenient. Total number of fouls and cards per match were
      consistently lower in the English Premier League, however attempted tackles per
      foul was higher. The data also demonstrate the notions of home advantage and
      potentially referee bias, since referees tended to call more fouls and award more
      cards to away teams. Lastly, number of attempted tackles per foul and yellow
      cards received exhibited the strongest correlations with final league position
      across the leagues. In conclusion, our data support that elite European soccer
      has become less aggressive and the English Premier League is the most aggressive 
      league.

TI  - Testosterone and cortisol responses in male soccer players: The effect of home
      and away venues.

AB  - The present studies examined the influence of playing venue on psychobiological
      responses in male soccer players. Many studies have demonstrated the existence of
      a home advantage, wherein teams perform better at home than away. A recent focus 
      has attempted to explain this advantage from a psychobiological perspective, with
      studies showing hormonal differences with regard to venue, game outcome,
      dominance and perceived stress. Two studies investigated testosterone and
      cortisol responses in relation to home and away venues. In an initial study of 18
      male elite Premier League academy soccer players (age, 17.47, SD, 64), salivary
      cortisol levels were monitored in two competitive matches, both at home and away.
      Higher post-game cortisol levels were observed at home (p=0.002), with the team
      winning all its games. In a second study involving a 12 semi-professional group
      of players (age, 23.17, SD, 3.8), the same post-game cortisol findings at home
      were replicated (p=0.001), with this team losing all its games. No effects were
      observed for testosterone in either study. The results extend earlier research
      findings on the complex relationship which surrounds the psychobiological impact 
      on the home advantage. The findings suggest that higher levels of stress are
      experienced by home players in their home matches.

TI  - Inconsistency of decision-making, the Achilles heel of referees.
PG  - 2257-2261
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2016.1265143 [doi]
AB  - This study assessed whether decisions made by six qualified referees were
      consistent when watching the live 2016 televised Champions League Final. Referees
      were paired off into three separate rooms. Two referees watched the game with no 
      supporters present. Two watched the game surrounded by Real Madrid supporters,
      and the remaining two watched the game surrounded by Athletic Madrid supporters. 
      Referees were asked to decide whether each decision made by the on-field referee 
      was either correct or incorrect. Results identified two types of refereeing
      inconsistency. The first type was a systematic tendency of the supporting crowds 
      (both rooms) to influence the adjudicating referees to make fewer incorrect
      (disagree with the on-field referee) decisions (8 and 5) than referees in the "no
      supporters" room (19) (chi(2) = 11.22 [df = 2], P = 0.004). The second type of
      inconsistency was the home advantage "bias", where the surrounding crowd
      influenced the adjudicating referees to favour their team, by disagreeing with
      the decision made by the on-field referee (chi(2) = 6.0 [df = 2], P = 0.0498).
      One explanation for these inconsistencies is that referees adopt a coping
      strategy of "avoidance", i.e., when faced with difficult decisions, referees
      simply avoid making unpopular decisions by waving "play on".

TI  - Injuries and home advantage in the NFL.
PG  - 1734
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the first decade of this century players in the National Football 
      League, the NFL community, fans, even the public at large, became aware that
      multiple concussions, heretofore considered inconsequential, could have
      devastating consequences later in life. RESULTS: Since 1978, each one of the 32
      teams in the NFL plays 16 games in the regular season. In the 25 years from 1978 
      to 2004 home advantage in the regular season tended to increase with Game Number 
      (1-16). Then in the following decade (2005-2014) it changed direction and tended 
      clearly to decrease. The change in direction was highly reliable statistically.
      DISCUSSION: The result reported in this paper is an association in time between
      two striking events, a new consciousness regarding the long-term consequences of 
      concussions in football, and a change in the course of home advantage in the
      regular season. The paper then advances a possible explanation for this
      association. The home advantage may be equally well treated as an away
      disadvantage, the disadvantage being that away players tend to feel on the
      defensive, that both the hometown crowd and the officials are against them.
      Injuries put players on both teams on the defensive. The higher the percentage of
      players on a team who are injured or playing hurt (injury prevalence) the less
      likely it is that as-yet-uninjured players will adopt an attacking style of play.
      Injury prevalence increases linearly with Game Number. It turns out, however,
      that formal considerations require that injury prevalence be the same or close to
      it for teams playing at home and teams playing away. Therefore, the away
      disadvantage in total defensiveness (defensiveness due to playing away plus
      defensiveness due to injury) starts at 1 in the first game of the season,
      decreases steeply at first, and then decelerates as it approaches .5. This
      downward course of the away disadvantage in total defensiveness leads directly to
      a corresponding downward course of the home advantage in game outcome (by the
      teamwork theory of home advantage). CONCLUSIONS: Further research on the reported
      association or its explanation may be complicated by continued change in the
      association itself.

TI  - The Influence of Referee Bias on Extra Time in Elite Soccer Matches.
PG  - 666-77
LID - 10.1177/0031512516633342 [doi]
AB  - Referees have discretion over the addition of extra time at the end of the soccer
      game to compensate for lost time due to unusual stoppages. This study assesses if
      referees favor big teams by shortening close games where the big team is ahead
      and lengthening close games where the big team is behind. The sample comprises
      all 380 matches in the Spanish La Liga during the 2014-2015 season. The dependent
      variable was the extra time the referee decides to add to the second half. The
      independent variables were the score difference, opponent team's level of play,
      yellow cards, red cards, player substitutions, average attendance, and fouls
      committed. Linear regression analysis suggested that the greater the score
      difference between teams, the less extra time was added by the referee. However, 
      in close games, referees tended to add more time for a higher level team when
      they were behind and add less time when they were ahead. Red cards and the number
      of fouls committed increased the extra time.

TI  - Comparison of Home Advantage in College and Professional Team Sports in the
      United States.
PG  - 583-9
AB  - Home advantage in seven American college team sports (baseball, basketball,
      football, hockey, lacrosse, soccer and women's basketball) was compared with
      professional leagues in the United States for the same sports and for the same
      time period. A total of 81,063 college games and 22,477 professional games were
      analyzed for the four seasons 2006-07 to 2009-10. There was a significant home
      advantage, as measured by home winning percentage, in all sports, both college
      and professional. The overall home advantage in college sports was significantly 
      greater than in professional sports (p<0.015). The mean difference was 3.73 home 
      winning percentage points, being greatest for baseball, basketball, and hockey
      (all p<0.001). Plausible explanations for these results include differences in
      college and professional competition in terms of familiarity with local
      conditions, referee bias, territoriality and psychological factors. However, the 
      influence of travel fatigue was inconclusive. Only for soccer was the home
      advantage greater for professionals. This was the only sport where crowd size
      appeared to be having an effect. In addition the rules of college soccer allow
      more substitution and hence greater coach intervention than in professional
      soccer, a factor that could also be reducing home advantage.

      COMPETITION.
PG  - 666-74
LID - 10.2466/06.PMS.121c28x4 [doi]
AB  - This study was designed to pilot a survey to explore players' perception of home 
      advantage in a rugby league. Twenty-seven players from one team with an
      identified home advantage believed a home advantage existed as a result of their 
      home crowd (52%), family and friends' support (41%), normal travel (45%) and
      sleeping arrangements (37%), home weather conditions (48%), and familiarity with 
      playing amenities (37%). However, the players were less definite about influences
      while playing away from home. The current sample of players identified differing 
      influences, highlighting individual variations in perceived determinants.
      Individual interviews or focus groups will be required for further exploration.

AB  - Home advantage is smaller in baseball than in other major professional sports for
      men, specifically football, basketball, or soccer. This paper advances an
      explanation. It begins by reviewing the main observations to support the view
      that there is little or no home advantage in individual sports. It then presents 
      the case that home advantage originates in impaired teamwork among the away
      players. The need for teamwork and the extent of it vary from sport to sport. To 
      the extent that a sport requires little teamwork it is more like an individual
      sport, and the home team would be expected to enjoy only a small advantage.
      Interactions among players on the same side (teamwork) are much less common in
      baseball than in the other sports considered.

AB  - In soccer, home teams win about 67% of decided games. The causes for this home
      advantage are still unresolved. There is a shortage of research on the
      psychological states of actors involved. In this study, we examined soccer
      coaches' expectations, goal setting and tactical decisions in relation to game
      location. Soccer coaches (N = 297) with different expertise levels participated
      in an experimental, online management game and were randomly assigned to one of
      two groups, "home game (HG)" or "away game." Participants received information on
      the game for which they were asked to make decisions in multiple points. The only
      differing information between groups was game location. Regardless of expertise, 
      HG coaches had higher expectations to win, set more challenging goals and decided
      for more offensive and courageous playing tactics. Possible consequences of these
      findings concerning home advantage in soccer are discussed.

      the evaluation system of the home advantage proposed by Pollard (1986) contains
      serious inconsistencies when applied to competitions which give three points for 
      a win and one point for a draw, as it is the case of the UEFA football leagues in
      the 21th century.

AB  - The role of referees has become a central issue in the investigation of home
      advantage. The main aim of this study was a thorough examination of the referee
      bias concerning injury time in football, which is currently seen as an important 
      example for the assertion that referees contribute to home advantage. First, we
      use archival data from the German Bundesliga (seasons 2000/2001-2010/2011) to
      confirm the existence of an asymmetry in the allocation of injury time. We show
      this asymmetry to be a bias by ruling out hitherto remaining alternative
      explanations (effect = 18 s, P < 0.001, R2(adj) = 0.05). Second, we identify a
      further referee bias, stating that referees systematically accord more injury
      time when one team leads in the game compared to a draw (effect = 21 s, P =
      0.004, R2(adj) = 0.06). Third, the quantitative benefit of home or away teams in 
      goals and points due to these biases is assessed. Overall, referee decisions on
      injury time indeed reveal biases, but they do not contribute to the home
      advantage, that is, there is no significant effect on goals scored by the teams. 
      The qualitative findings (a new bias on injury time) as well as the quantitative 
      findings (no overall effect) shed new light on the role of referees for home
      advantage.

AB  - A recent article published in the Journal of Human Kinetics (Saavedra et al.,

      values in soccer leagues. This led to incorrect calculations, false conclusions
      and some misleading results about home advantage in 52 soccer leagues of UEFA
      countries over a 10 year period. The aim of this letter was to explain these
      flaws and to make sure future research would not be influenced by the subsequent 
      results and conclusions that had been presented.

PG  - 401-10
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000408 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of weather,
      rank, and home advantage on international football match results and scores in
      the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. METHODS: Football matches (n = 2008)
      in six GCC countries were analyzed. To determine the weather influence on the
      likelihood of favorable outcome and goal difference, generalized linear model
      with a logit link function and multiple regression analysis were performed.
      RESULTS: In the GCC region, home teams tend to have greater likelihood of a
      favorable outcome (P < 0.001) and higher goal difference (P < 0.001). Temperature
      difference was identified as a significant explanatory variable when used
      independently (P < 0.001) or after adjustment for home advantage and team ranking
      (P < 0.001). The likelihood of favorable outcome for GCC teams increases by 3%
      for every 1-unit increase in temperature difference. After inclusion of
      interaction with opposition, this advantage remains significant only when playing
      against non-GCC opponents. While home advantage increased the odds of favorable
      outcome (P < 0.001) and goal difference (P < 0.001) after inclusion of
      interaction term, the likelihood of favorable outcome for a GCC team decreased (P
      < 0.001) when playing against a stronger opponent. Finally, the temperature and
      wet bulb globe temperature approximation were found as better indicators of the
      effect of environmental conditions than absolute and relative humidity or heat
      index on match outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In GCC region, higher temperature increased
      the likelihood of a favorable outcome when playing against non-GCC teams.
      However, international ranking should be considered because an opponent with a
      higher rank reduced, but did not eliminate, the likelihood of a favorable
      outcome.

PG  - 116-22
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2012.736537 [doi]
AB  - Home advantage as it relates to team performance at football was examined in
      Superleague Greece using nine seasons of game-by-game performance data, a total
      of 2160 matches. After adjusting for team ability and annual fluctuations in home
      advantage, there were significant differences between teams. Previous findings
      regarding the role of territorial protection were strengthened by the fact that
      home advantage was above average for the team from Xanthi (P =0.015), while lower
      for teams from the capital city Athens (P =0.008). There were differences between
      home and away teams in the incidence of most of the 13 within-game match
      variables, but associated effect sizes were only moderate. In contrast, outcome
      ratios derived from these variables, and measuring shot success, had negligible
      effect sizes. This supported a previous finding that home and away teams differed
      in the incidence of on-the-ball behaviours, but not in their outcomes. By far the
      most important predictor of home advantage, as measured by goal difference, was
      the difference between home and away teams in terms of kicked shots from inside
      the penalty area. Other types of shots had little effect on the final score. The 
      absence of a running track between spectators and the playing field was also a
      significant predictor of goal difference, worth an average of 0.102 goals per
      game to the home team. Travel distance did not affect home advantage.

AB  - Most research into home advantage is based on men's sports. This article analyses
      home advantage in the women's domestic football leagues of Europe and makes a
      comparison with the corresponding men's football leagues. A total of 47,042 games
      were included. From 2004 to 2010, home advantage existed in the domestic women's 
      soccer leagues of all 26 European countries analysed, ranging from 51.0% to 58.8%
      and averaging 54.2%. In every country, this was less than the corresponding men's
      home advantage which averaged 60.0%. Crowd effects, both on players and referees,
      and different gender perceptions of territorial protection are plausible reasons 
      for the differences found. Using a regression model that controlled for the
      competitive balance of each league, as well as for crowd size, the Gender Gap
      Index, which quantifies the status of women in each country, was a significant
      predictor of the difference between men's and women's home advantage. As the
      status of women becomes closer to that of men within a country, the difference in
      home advantage is less between the men's and women's football leagues.

AB  - Home advantage is well documented in a wide range of team sports including
      association football (soccer). Home team crowd support has been shown to be a
      likely causal factor and its influence on referee decision-making appears to play
      a significant role. Match data from the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons of the
      Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League and Europa League
      were used to investigate referee bias in terms of the association between match
      location (home vs. away) and disciplinary sanctions used by football referees.
      The adjusted mean number of yellow cards received by home and away teams and the 
      ratios of these means were estimated from Poisson regression models. After
      controlling for within-match measures of attacking dominance referees in the
      Champions League and Europa League issued 25% (p<0.001) and 10% (p=0.002) more
      yellow cards, respectively, to away teams than to home teams. The higher level of
      home team bias in the Champions League appeared to be mainly due to higher crowd 
      densities. In a combined analysis of both UEFA leagues the magnitude of referee
      bias increased with increasing crowd density (p<0.001). Crowd size and crowd
      proximity were not associated with referee bias after controlling for crowd
      density. These results provide further evidence that crowd support influences
      referee decisions. Failure to control for within-match team performance may
      over-estimate the extent of referee bias in terms of the number of disciplinary
      sanctions used.

AB  - The current study explored the effects of short haul air travel within the same
      country on elite Australian rugby league (RL) players (n=12) during two away and 
      two home games of elite competition. Physiological tests of handgrip strength and
      leg power were assessed along with psychological tests and perceptions of leg
      soreness and tiredness on the day before the game (Time 1 and Time 2) and on game
      day (Time 3). Game statistics of tackles and metres gained were assessed for the 
      games analysed. Significant differences were found for daily analyses of life
      demands for athletes (DALDA) worse than normal responses at Time 2 (2.50 +/- 3.23
      vs. 3.50 +/- 3.93; P=0.04), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) at Time 2 (2.88 +/-
      1.51 vs. 3.71 +/- 1.37; P=0.011) and leg tiredness at Time 3 (3.38 +/- 1.66 vs.
      2.35 +/- 1.70; P=0.004) between home and away games. The analysis of game
      statistics identified that more metres were gained during home games (83.6 +/-
      49.1 vs. 63.0 +/- 30.1; P=0.02) and more tackles made while playing away (18.4
      +/- 9.2 vs. 14.3 +/- 6.7; P=0.016). The results suggest that short haul air
      travel without crossing time zones results in symptoms of travel fatigue but does
      not appear to negatively impact on elite RL players ability to perform strength
      and power tasks. Different game tactics (attacking vs. defensive) occurred
      between home and away games however, it is unclear whether travel fatigue or a
      home advantage (HA) is associated with this finding.

LID - 10.2478/hukin-2013-0054 [doi]
AB  - Home advantage has been studied in different sports, establishing its existence
      and its possible causes. This article analyzes the home advantage in soccer
      leagues of UEFA countries in the first part of the 21st century. The sample of 52
      countries monitored during a period of 10 years allows us to study 520 leagues
      and 111,030 matches of the highest level in each country associated with UEFA.
      Home advantage exists and is significant in 32 of the 52 UEFA countries, where it
      equals 55.6%. A decrease can be observed in the tendency towards home advantage
      between the years 2000 and 2010. Values between 55 and 56 were observed for home 
      advantage in the top ten leagues in Europe. It has also been observed that home
      advantage depends on the level of the league evaluated using UEFA's 2010/11
      Country coefficients. The home advantage is calculated taking into account the
      teams' position and the points obtained in each of the leagues. A direct
      relationship was observed with the number of points gained and an inverse
      relationship was observed with the team position.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to quantify the home advantage in both men's and
      women's First and Second Division water polo leagues, to compare the results
      obtained according to sex of participants and the level of competition, and to
      test for possible differences in home advantage when considering the interaction 
      between these two factors. The sample comprised four seasons from 2007-2008 to
      2010-2011 for a total of 1942 games analyzed. The results showed the existence of
      home advantage in both men's and women's First and Second Divisions. After
      controlling for the competitive balance of each league in each season, there was 
      a significant difference between men's and women's leagues, with higher home
      advantage for men's leagues (58.60% compared with 53.70% for women's leagues).
      There was also a significant difference between the levels of competition, with
      greater home advantage for the Second Division (57.95% compared with 54.35% for
      First Division). No significant differences in home advantage were found when
      considering the interaction between sex of participants and the level of
      competition. The results in relation to sex of participants and the level of
      competition are consistent with previous studies in other sports such as football
      or handball.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to quantify the magnitude of home
      advantage (HA) in Australian soccer and to investigate how home-team crowd
      support and away-team travel may contribute to it. DESIGN: A paired design was
      used wherein each match contributed two observations, one for the home team and
      one for the away team. METHODS: The data used in this study were all matches from
      the first seven seasons (2005/06-2011/12) of the Australian A-League - the major 
      soccer league in Australia. Repeated measures Poisson regression analysis was
      used to investigate the effect that crowd size and density, distance and
      direction travelled by away teams, and crossing time zones may have on HA.
      RESULTS: HA in terms of the percentage of competition points gained by home teams
      in the A-League averaged 58% over the study period. HA increased significantly
      with increasing number of time zones crossed by away teams (p<0.001). HA also
      appeared to increase with increasing crowd size (p=0.07) but only up to about
      20,000 persons. Crowd density, distance travelled and direction travelled were
      not independently associated with HA. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest
      that in soccer competitions where time zones are crossed, travel effects such as 
      jet lag may play an even greater role in HA than home-team crowd support. Travel 
      management programs aimed at reducing the effects of jet lag could significantly 
      improve away team performance in Australian soccer.

AB  - Possession is thought of as central to success in modern football, but questions 
      remain about its impact on positive team outcomes (Bate, 1988; Hughes & Franks,
      2005; Pollard & Reep, 1997; Stanhope, 2001). Recent studies (e.g. Bloomfield,
      Polman, & O'Donoghue, 2005; Carling, Williams, & Reilly, 2005; James, Mellallieu,
      & Holley, 2002; Jones, James, & Mellalieu, 2004; Lago, 2009; Lago & Martin, 2007;
      Lago-Penas & Dellal, 2010; Lago-Penas, Lago-Ballesteros, Dellal, & Gomez, 2010;
      Taylor, Mellalieu, & James, 2005; Tucker, Mellalieu, James, & Taylor, 2005) that 
      have examined these questions have often been constrained by an exclusive focus
      on English or Spanish domestic play. Using data from five European leagues, UEFA 
      and FIFA tournaments, the study found that while possession time and passing
      predicted aggregated team success in domestic league play, both variables were
      poor predictors at the individual match level once team quality and home
      advantage were accounted for. In league play, the effect of greater possession
      was consistently negative; in the Champions League, it had virtually no impact.
      In national team tournaments, possession failed to reach significance when
      offensive factors were accounted for. Much of the success behind the 'possession 
      game' was thus a function of elite teams confined in geographic and competitive
      space. That ball hegemony was not consistently tied to success suggests that a
      nuanced approach to possession is needed to account for variant strategic
      environments (e.g. James et al., 2002) and compels match analysts to re-examine
      the metric's overall value.

TI  - Comparison of the home advantage in nine different professional team sports in
      Spain.
PG  - 150-6
AB  - Home advantage is a well-established phenomenon in many sports. The present study
      is unique in that it includes different sports analysed in the same country, at
      the same level of competition, and over the same time period. Nine team sports
      from Spain were included: baseball, basketball, handball, indoor soccer, roller
      hockey, rugby, soccer, volleyball, and water polo. Data for five seasons
      (2005-2006 to 2009-2010) were obtained, totaling 9,472 games. The results
      confirmed the existence of home advantage in all nine sports. There was a
      statistically significant difference between the sports; home advantage was
      highest in rugby (67.0%), and lowest in volleyball (55.7%), water polo (56.2%),
      and roller hockey (58.3%). The design of the study controlled for some of the
      likely causes of home advantage, and the results suggested that the high home
      advantage for rugby was likely a reflection of the continuous, aggressive, and
      intense nature of the sport.

AB  - Home advantage in team sports has an important role in determining the outcome of
      a game. The aim of the present study was to identify the soccer game- related
      statistics that best discriminate home and visiting teams according to the team
      quality. The sample included all 380 games of the Spanish professional men's
      league. The independent variables were game location (home or away) and the team 
      quality. Teams were classified into four groups according to their final ranking 
      at the end of the league. The game-related statistics registered were divided
      into three groups: (i) variables related to goals scored; (ii) variables related 
      to offense and (iii) variables related to defense. A univariate (t-test and
      Mann-Whitney U) and multivariate (discriminant analysis) analysis of data was
      done. Results showed that home teams have significantly higher means for goal
      scored, total shots, shots on goal, attacking moves, box moves, crosses, offsides

      confounding variables such as weather conditions, game status and team form. Key 
      pointsHome teams have significantly higher figures for attack indicators probably
      due to facilities familiarity and crowd effects.The teams' game-related

      described as superior and those described as inferior did not experience the same
      home advantage.

TI  - Crowd noise as a cue in referee decisions contributes to the home advantage.
PG  - 483-98
AB  - The home advantage is one of the best established phenomena in sports (Courneya &
      Carron, 1992), and crowd noise has been suggested as one of its determinants
      (Nevill & Holder, 1999). However, the psychological processes that mediate crowd 
      noise influence and its contribution to the home advantage are still unclear. We 
      propose that crowd noise correlates with the criteria referees have to judge. As 
      crowd noise is a valid cue, referee decisions are strongly influenced by crowd
      noise. Yet, when audiences are not impartial, a home advantage arises. Using
      soccer as an exemplar, we show the relevance of this influence in predicting
      outcomes of real games via a database analysis. Then we experimentally
      demonstrate the influence of crowd noise on referees' yellow cards decisions in
      soccer. Finally, we discuss why the focus on referee decisions is useful, and how
      more experimental research could benefit investigations of the home advantage.

TI  - An analysis of home advantage in the top two Spanish professional football
      leagues.
PG  - 789-97
AB  - This study examines the effect of the points system on home advantage in the two 
      top Spanish professional football divisions between the 1980-1981 and 2006-2007
      seasons. From 1980-81, teams were awarded 2 points for a win. This was increased 
      to 3 points starting in 1995-1996. Lower home advantage was expected with the
      3-point system as a consequence of encouraging more attacking play from away
      teams. The results of an analysis of 20,992 games showed no significant
      differences in home advantage values between the First Division (66.3% before and
      62.1% after the 3-point system) and the Second Division (65.6% before and 59.5%
      after). Nevertheless, there was a significant decrease in home advantage in both 
      the First and Second Divisions after the introduction of the 3-point system. The 
      results were compared with two similar studies of professional football in
      England.

AB  - The home advantage effect was investigated at a team and player level in Union of
      European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League football using in-depth
      performance and disciplinary variables. Performance analysis revealed that the
      home team scored more goals, had more shots on and off target, had a greater
      share of possession, and won more corners than the away team. There was an
      opposite trend for disciplinary variables, with the home team committing less
      fouls than the away team, and receiving less yellow and red cards. There were
      home advantage effects at player level for goals, total shots, shots on target,
      assists, and yellow cards, as found in the team analysis. In addition, foreign
      players demonstrated a home advantage effect for goals scored, whereas domestic
      players scored an equivalent number of goals at home and away venues. Results are
      discussed in relation to the home advantage literature and wider implications for
      the sport.

TI  - Home advantage in Turkish professional soccer.
PG  - 51-4
AB  - Home advantage is known to play an important role in the outcome of professional 
      soccer games and to vary considerably worldwide. In the Turkish Super League over
      the last 12 years, 61.5% of the total points gained have been won by the home
      team, a figure similar to the worldwide average and to the Premier League in
      England. It is lower (57.7%) for games played between teams from Istanbul and
      especially high for games involving teams from cities in the more remote and
      ethnically distinct parts of Turkey (Van and Diyarbakir). Match performance data 
      show that although home teams in Turkey take 26% more shots at goal than away
      teams, the success rates for shots do not differ. For fouls and disciplinary
      cards, home and away teams do not differ significantly in Turkey, a finding that 
      differs from games in England, perhaps due to less referee bias.

AB  - Analysis of approximately 100 years of home-and-away South American World Cup
      matches illustrate that football competition at moderate/high altitude (>2000 m) 
      favors the home team, although this is more than compensated by the likelihood of
      sea-level teams winning at home against the same opponents who have descended
      from altitude. Nevertheless, the home team advantage at altitudes above
      approximately 2000 m may reflect that traditionally, teams from sea level or low 
      altitude have not spent 1-2 weeks acclimatizing at altitude. Despite large
      differences between individuals, in the first few days at high altitude (e.g. La 
      Paz, 3600 m) some players experience symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS)
      such as headache and disrupted sleep, and their maximum aerobic power (VO2max) is
      approximately 25% reduced while their ventilation, heart rate and blood lactate
      during submaximal exercise are elevated. Simulated altitude for a few weeks
      before competition at altitude can be used to attain partial ventilatory
      acclimation and ameliorated symptoms of AMS. The variety of simulated altitude
      exposures usually created with enriched nitrogen mixtures of air include resting 
      or exercising for a few hours per day or sleeping approximately 8 h/night in
      hypoxia. Preparation for competition at moderate/high altitude by training at
      altitude is probably superior to simulated exposure; however, the optimal
      duration at moderate/high altitude is unclear. Preparing for 1-2 weeks at
      moderate/high altitude is a reasonable compromise between the benefits associated
      with overcoming AMS and partial restoration of VO2max vs the likelihood of
      detraining.

AB  - This study examined whether home advantage occurred in the Six Nations Rugby
      Union tournament. Data were gathered using the final championship standings from 
      the tournament's inception in 2000 to the recently completed 2007 season. Home
      advantage for each championship season was defined as the number of points won by
      teams playing at home, expressed as a percentage of all points gained either at
      home or away. An analysis of home advantage for each of eight seasons of
      competition ranged from 53% (2005) to 70% (2006). There was an overall
      statistically significant home advantage of 61% for 120 matches played in the Six
      Nations tournament between 2000 and 2007. Also analysed were the percentage of
      points won at home by each country. Again, evidence supported home advantage
      amongst all competing nations regardless of the team's quality.

TI  - The influence of game location and outcome on behaviour and mood states among
      professional rugby league players.
PG  - 1491-500
AB  - In this study, we examined the relationship between home and away matches on
      mood. In addition, the relationships between game location, game outcome,
      behavioural factors, and mood were investigated among 12 professional English
      rugby league players competing in the Super League. Participants completed daily 
      diaries for 27 days. The diary consisted of six analogue scales measuring mood
      (relaxed-tense, energetic-weary, depressed-elated, tired-alert, anxious-calm,
      cheerful-miserable) as well as behavioural factors and self-rated performance.
      There were no significant differences in self-reported mood states leading up to 
      home or away matches except for players feeling more tired when playing away.
      Significant relationships between mood and behaviours (e.g. sleep and eating) and
      subjective performance were observed. The outcome of the match was found to
      influence mood, with a defeat resulting in decreased mood. Our results show that 
      game location did not influence mood and therefore does not provide an
      explanation for the home advantage.

TI  - The second leg home advantage: evidence from European football cup competitions.
PG  - 1547-56
AB  - The home advantage is a widely acknowledged sporting phenomenon, especially in
      association football. Here, we examine the second leg home advantage, an effect
      that is discussed in the public domain but which has received very little
      scientific attention. The second leg home advantage effect occurs when on average
      teams are more likely to win a two-stage knock-out competition when they play at 
      home in the second leg. That is, both teams have a home advantage but this
      advantage is significantly greater for the team that plays at home second.
      Examining data from three different European Cup football competitions spanning
      51 years, we show that the second leg home advantage is a real phenomenon. The
      second leg home team has more than a 50% probability to qualify for the next
      round in the competition even after controlling for extra time and team ability
      as possible alternative explanations. The second leg home advantage appears,
      however, to have decreased significantly over the past decade. Possible reasons
      for its existence and subsequent decline are presented.

TI  - Referee bias contributes to home advantage in English Premiership football.
PG  - 1185-94
AB  - Officiating bias is thought to contribute to home advantage. Recent research has 
      shown that sports with subjective officiating tend to experience greater home
      advantage and that referees' decisions can be influenced by crowd noise, but
      little work has been done to examine whether individual referees vary in their
      home bias or whether biased decisions contribute to overall home advantage. We
      develop an ordinal regression model to determine whether various measures of home
      advantage are affected by the official for the match and by crowd size while
      controlling for team ability. We examine 5244 English Premier League (EPL) match 
      results involving 50 referees and find that home bias differs between referees.
      Individual referees give significantly different levels of home advantage,
      measured as goal differential between the home and away teams, although the
      significance of this result depends on one referee with a particularly high home 
      advantage (an outlier). Referees vary significantly and robustly in their yellow 
      card and penalty differentials even excluding the outlier. These results confirm 
      that referees are responsible for some of the observed home advantage in the EPL 
      and suggest that home advantage is dependent on the subjective decisions of
      referees that vary between individuals. We hypothesize that individual referees
      respond differently to factors such as crowd noise and suggest further research
      looking at referees' psychological and behavioural responses to biased crowds.

TI  - Influence of ball type on home advantage in French professional soccer.
PG  - 347-51
AB  - The home advantage has been consistently found in soccer matches, but conclusive 
      evidence of the origin of this home advantage has yet to be identified. One
      factor often thought to contribute is familiarity with a local facility. The
      present study examined home advantage in the French professional soccer male
      championships (20 teams in each Ligue 1 and 2) and explored the influence of
      soccer ball type on this phenomenon. Whether it is knowing how a soccer ball
      rolls on a particular grass surface or some other aspect, the home team can react
      to the situation better if they know from experience what is likely to happen.
      The results suggest that type of soccer ball may have an influence on home
      advantage. Confounding factors are discussed.

TI  - English soccer teams' aggressive behavior when playing away from home.
PG  - 317-20
AB  - Speculation about key factors affecting home advantage still exists. The present 
      study investigated aggressive behavior amongst English Football Premiership
      (soccer) players and its relation to home advantage. The frequency of aggressive 
      behaviour, identified by the award of a penalty or disciplinary card (yellow for 
      caution or red for dismissal) was analysed over 2000-2003. Chi-square analyses
      assessed whether a greater frequency of aggressive behavior was performed by
      teams away from home. In decided matches, teams playing away received
      significantly more cautions (yellow cards) than home teams. A further analysis of
      tied matches indicated that away teams received significantly more cautions
      (yellow cards) than home teams. No significant differences between home and away 
      teams were found for dismissals and penalties awarded. Reasons for these findings
      are considered.

TI  - Home advantage in southern hemisphere rugby union: national and international.
PG  - 495-9
AB  - This study evaluates home advantages both for national (Super 12) and
      international (Tri-nations) rugby union teams from South Africa, Australia and
      New Zealand, over the five-year period 2000 - 2004 using linear modelling. These 
      home advantages are examined for statistical and practical significance, for
      variability between teams, for stability over time and for inter-correlation.
      These data reveal that the overall home advantage in elite rugby union has a mean
      of +6.7 points, and that this changes little from year to year. Closer scrutiny
      nevertheless reveals a high degree of variability. Different teams can and do
      have different home advantages, which ranges from a low of -0.7 to a high of
      +28.3 points in any one year. Furthermore, some team home advantages change up or
      down from one year to the next, by as much as -36.5 to +31.4 points at the
      extremes. There is no evidence that the stronger teams have the higher home
      advantages, or that a high home advantage leads to a superior finishing position 
      in the competition.

TI  - Soccer Referee Decision-Making: 'shall I Blow the Whistle?'.
PG  - 243-53
AB  - Evidence points to the existence of a home advantage effect in soccer with
      referees giving more decisions to the home team being a plausible explanation for
      this effect. The purpose of the present study was to use qualitative methods to
      explore the factors that influence experienced referees when making decisions.
      Five experienced referees volunteered to participate in semi-structured
      interviews of 30-40 minutes duration. Examples of questions/probes included 'Are 
      there times when it is difficult to make a decision on whether there was a foul
      or not? When? Why?' and 'Do you worry about making the wrong / unpopular
      decision? What affect does this have on you?' Content analysis identified 13
      inter-related themes that describe four higher-order themes. The themes
      'accuracy-error', 'regulations', and 'professionalism' form a higher-order theme 
      labeled 'ideal-decision making'. The themes 'opinion', 'concentration', and
      'control' represent a higher- order theme labeled 'individual factors';
      'experience', 'personality', and 'personal life' represent a higher-order factor 
      labeled 'experience factors', and crowd factors, player reaction, environmental
      factors, and crowd interaction represent a higher-order factor labeled
      'situational factors'. Findings from the present study offer some insight into
      difficulties and coping strategies used by referees to perform consistently in
      professional soccer. Future research could use quantitative methods to test the
      relative contribution of themes identified above to the decision-making process
      in referees. At an applied level, practitioners should develop strategies that
      accelerate the process of learning to cope with performance-related stressors
      such as the crowd noise. Key PointsFive experienced described factors associated 
      with decision making in soccer leading to the identification of 13 inter-related 
      themes that describe four higher-order themes.Higher order themes include
      ideal-decision making', 'individual factors', 'experience factors', and
      'situational factors'.Findings from the present study offer some insight into

TI  - Worldwide regional variations in home advantage in association football.
PG  - 231-40
AB  - Home advantage plays an important part in determining the result of a game of
      football. Its existence and magnitude is well documented in England, but its
      causes are still not completely understood. In this study, reliable estimates of 
      home advantage are calculated for the domestic leagues of all countries of Europe
      and South America, as well as a selection of countries from other continents. The
      results of all games during the last six seasons are used for each of these 72
      countries. In Europe, home advantage in the Balkan countries, especially Bosnia
      and Albania, is much higher than average. It is generally lower than average in
      northern Europe, from the Baltic republics, through Scandinavia to the British
      Isles. In South America, home advantage is high in the Andean countries and lower
      elsewhere, especially in Uruguay. Home advantage is not unusually high or low in 
      any of the countries from other continents. A multiple regression model for the
      51 European countries, which included variables for geographical location, crowd 
      effects and travel, accounted for 76.7% of the variability in home advantage. The
      large geographical variations can be interpreted in terms of territoriality being
      a contributing factor to home advantage.

TI  - Temporal changes in home advantage in English football since the Second World
      War: what explains improved away performance?
PG  - 669-79
AB  - This study examined temporal trends in home advantage in the top two English
      football divisions and used change point analysis to test the hypothesis that
      home advantage has not remained constant over time. Regression analysis was used 
      to model the impact of substitutions (a proxy for "information transfer") and the
      points system on home advantage. The results suggest that changing from two
      points for a win to three points for a win has led to a 0.39 reduction (95%
      confidence interval=0.21 to 0.56) in the ratio of home wins to away wins.
      Increasing the number of substitutions is associated with a small increase in the
      ratio of home wins to away wins, although this is not statistically significant. 
      The evidence indicates that, in this particular context, the extent of home
      advantage has diminished. This contradicts most other published work, which
      suggests that home advantage is stable over time. I argue that this reduction is 
      more likely to be the result of the introduction of three points for a win, which
      has lessened the incentives for away teams to settle for a draw, than an increase
      in "information transfer". Research into temporal trends in home advantage is
      interesting in its own right but might, in addition, shed light on determinants
      of the home advantage phenomenon.

TI  - Home advantage and the debate about competitive balance in professional sports
      leagues.
PG  - 439-45
AB  - A recurrent theme in sports economics is the extent to which overall league
      attendances will be raised by measures, such as revenue sharing, which aim to
      improve competitive balance. This debate has ignored the phenomenon of home
      advantage, which may, however, be important to the extent that, if all teams had 
      equal talent, all matches may then be weighted heavily in favour of the home
      team. We present an analysis of the relationship between attendance and
      match-level uncertainty in the English Football League. A simulation from our
      model indicates that equality of playing talent would in fact lower aggregate
      attendance. This result is explained by the loss of prospectively the most
      uncertain games, where weak teams have home advantage over strong teams.

TI  - Home advantage in speed skating: evidence from individual data.
PG  - 417-27
AB  - Home advantage is a well-documented phenomenon in many sports. Home advantage has
      been shown to exist for team sports (soccer, hockey, football, baseball,
      basketball) and for countries organizing sports tournaments like the Olympics and
      World Cup Soccer. There is also some evidence for home advantage in some
      individual sports, but there is a much more limited literature. This paper
      addresses the issue of home advantage in speed skating. From a methodological
      point of view, it is difficult to identify home advantage, because skaters vary
      in their abilities and the conditions of tournaments vary. There is a small but
      significant home advantage using a generalized linear mixed model, with random
      effects for skaters and fixed effects for skating rinks and seasons. Even though 
      the home advantage effect exists, it is very small when compared to variation in 
      skating times due to differences of rinks and individual abilities.

TI  - Home advantage in the Australian Football League.
PG  - 375-85
AB  - The results of this study on home advantage in Australian rules football
      demonstrate that individual clubs have different home advantages. Traditional
      measures of home advantage as applied to whole competitions such as percentage of
      games won, and alternative measures such as average margin of victory for the
      home team, are calculated. Problems with these measures are discussed. Individual
      home advantages for each team are obtained using a linear model fitted to
      individual match margins; the resultant home advantages are analysed, and
      variations and possible causes or groupings of home advantage are proposed. It is
      shown that some models allowing different home advantages for different clubs are
      a significant improvement over previous models assuming a common home advantage. 
      The results show a strong isolation effect, with non-Victorian teams having large
      home advantages, and lend support to the conclusion that crowd effects and ground
      familiarity are a major determinant of home advantage.

TI  - Football supporters' perceptions of their role in the home advantage.
PG  - 365-74
AB  - Football fans' views on their role in the home advantage were obtained by placing
      links to an internet questionnaire on supporters' websites. Altogether, 461 fans 
      from clubs which had been promoted, relegated or unchanged in the past season of 
      the English football leagues rated crowd support as significantly more
      influential than familiarity, travel, territoriality and referee bias in
      contributing to the home advantage. Fans felt responsible for inspiring their
      team to victory, took credit for distracting opponents, and believed that they
      could influence officials into making decisions in their team's favour. However, 
      they did not accept personal blame for poor results. No effects for gender, age
      or the team's outcome in the promotion/relegation battle emerged, though season
      ticket holders were more extreme in their feelings of responsibility overall.
      Furthermore, it was suggested that mechanisms such as the perception of being
      superior to rivals can encourage fans to retain their allegiance to their teams, 
      even when outcomes are disappointing. Indeed, affiliation may become so
      incorporated into self-identity that supporters may not have the option of
      abandoning their team, but instead perceive a reciprocal relationship in which
      both they and the team are expected to do their best to achieve success.

TI  - An analysis of home advantage in the English Football Premiership.
PG  - 1212-6
AB  - Home advantage has been examined across different sports. Pollard provided
      evidence of this phenomenon in association football (soccer). This present study 
      further considers the prevalence in the English Football Premiership, a division 
      created from the former Football Association First Division in 1992. Archived
      data were obtained for the First Division seasons 1984--5 to 1991--2 from the
      Football Statistics Archive and for the English Football Premiership (1992--3 to 
      2002--3). Chi square analysis confirmed home advantage from season to season
      since 1984 (p<.05). Analysis of variance compared Pollard's findings and data for
      the English Football Premiership (1992--2003), as well as the intervening period 
      (1984--92). Home advantage was significantly lower in these more recent periods. 
      Possible factors contributing to the apparent decline in home advantage were
      highlighted.

TI  - Testosterone, territoriality, and the 'home advantage'.
PG  - 269-75
AB  - The consistently better performance seen by teams in various sporting contexts
      when playing at home is referred to as the 'home advantage'. Various explanations
      have been put forward to account for this robust phenomenon, though none has yet 
      focussed on possible hormonal factors. In an initial study, we showed that
      salivary testosterone levels in soccer players were significantly higher before a
      home game than an away game.In a second study involving a different group of
      soccer players, this finding was replicated over two home games, two away games, 
      and three training sessions. Perceived rivalry of the opposing team was important
      as testosterone levels were higher before playing an 'extreme' rival than a
      'moderate' rival. Self-reported measures of mood in both studies were not linked 
      to testosterone level. The present results corroborate and extend earlier
      findings on the relationships between testosterone, territoriality, and dominance
      in human competitive encounters and further suggest an important role for
      testosterone in the home advantage seen in various team sports.

TI  - Identifying home advantage in international tennis and golf tournaments.
PG  - 437-43
AB  - A regression analysis of competitors' tournament results in relation to their
      world rankings was proposed to identify the effect of home advantage in
      international 'grand-slam' tennis and 'major' golf tournaments. The results
      provided little evidence of home advantage in either the grand-slam tennis or the
      golf tournaments held in 1993. The only possible evidence of home advantage was
      found in the Wimbledon tennis and the US Open golf championships. Even these
      findings can be explained, at least partially, by (1) the availability of
      information concerning the low world rankings of the British tennis players
      competing at Wimbledon, and (2) selective entry, allowing only the world's
      top-ranked foreign golfers into the US open golf tournament. In both cases, the
      lower ranking home competitors have a greater opportunity to perform above their 
      anticipated world rankings. Therefore, provided entry into tennis and golf
      tournaments is truly 'open' to both the host nation's representatives and foreign
      competitors alike, home advantage does not appear to be a major factor
      influencing the competitors' performance in such competitions. These findings may
      be explained by the relatively objective nature of the scoring systems used in
      tennis and golf, unlike the subjective influence of refereeing decisions on the
      results of team-games such as soccer.

TI  - Effect of travel and rest on performance of professional basketball players.
PG  - 366-9
AB  - We have studied 8,495 regular season games in the National Basketball Association
      over eight seasons (1987-1988 through 1994-1995) to analyze the effects of travel
      and rest on performance. We found that more time between games improved
      performance, an effect that was constant over time and statistically significant.
      More than 1 day between games increased the home team's score by 1.1 points and
      the visitor's by 1.6 points. Peak performance occurred with 3 days between games.
      The negative effects of little time between games may be due to lack of time for 
      physical recovery, rather than any effects of circadian rhythm (jet lag). We
      found few consistent effects of distance traveled or direction of travel. We did 
      find a suggestion of circadian rhythm effects in a subanalysis of games on either
      coast in which the visitor traveled across the country, while the home team did
      not travel (n = 101). In these games, the visiting team did four points better (p
      = 0.07) when they traveled west to east rather than east to west, almost
      nullifying the home-court advantage. This effect, like similar findings for
      Monday Night Football games, may be due to West Coast visitors playing night
      games at an earlier time according to their "internal clock". An incidental
      finding in our study was that the home-court advantage decreased over 8 years,
      from about six points to three points (due to relatively lower field-goal
      percentages and fewer free throws by the home team).

TI  - Circadian rhythms and enhanced athletic performance in the National Football
      League.
PG  - 362-5
AB  - Circadian rhythms produce daily changes in critical elements of athletic
      performance. We explored the significance of performing at different circadian
      times in the National Football League (NFL) over the last 25 seasons. West Coast 
      (WC) NFL teams should have a circadian advantage over East Coast (EC) teams
      during Monday Night Football (MNF) games because WC teams are essentially playing
      closer to the proposed peak athletic performance time of day. Retrospective data 
      analysis was applied to all games involving WC versus EC teams playing on MNF
      with start times of 9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) from the 1970-1994
      seasons. Logistic regression analysis of win-loss records relative to point
      spreads and home-field advantage was examined. West Coast teams win more often (p
      < 0.01) and by more points per game than EC teams. West Coast teams are
      performing significantly (p < 0.01) better than is predicted by the Las Vegas
      odds (the point spread). This apparent advantage enhances home-field advantage
      for WC teams and essentially eliminates the beneficial effects of home-field
      advantage for EC teams during MNF games. These results support the presence of an
      enhancement of athletic performance at certain circadian times of the day.

TI  - Factors associated with home advantage in English and Scottish soccer matches.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - Using the results from the end-of-season (1992-93) league tables, overall home
      advantage was confirmed in the eight major divisions of the English and Scottish 
      football leagues. The degree of home advantage was found to vary significantly
      across the divisions. Furthermore, these divisional differences in home advantage
      were found to be significantly associated with the mean attendance of each
      division. In an attempt to understand these findings, every occurrence of two
      influential events (either a sending-off or penalty scored) reported in a
      national Sunday newspaper was recorded. The overall frequency of both
      sendings-off and penalties scored favoured the home side, but again this was not 
      constant across the divisions. In divisions with large crowds, the percentage of 
      home sendings-off was relatively small (30%), compared with no difference (50%)
      in divisions with smaller crowds. Similarly, the percentage of penalties scored
      by home sides in divisions with the largest crowds was large ( > 70%), in
      contrast to little or no advantage in divisions with smaller crowds. Two possible
      explanations for these findings were proposed. Either larger crowds were able to 
      provoke the away player into more reckless behaviour (real fouls), or influence
      the referee into believing that the away player had committed more fouls
      (perceived fouls).

TI  - Home advantage in soccer: a retrospective analysis.
PG  - 237-48
AB  - The existence of home advantage has been established for all major professional
      team sports in England and North America. The advantage was found to be greatest 
      in soccer, with the home team currently obtaining about 64% of all points gained 
      in the English Football League. Home advantage has changed very little since the 
      formation of the League in 1888 and there are only small variations between the
      four Divisions of the League. The advantage is less marked in local derbies, in
      the FA Cup and in nonprofessional competitions. It is greater in the European Cup
      and increases as the stages of the competition progress. The allocation of three 
      points, instead of two, for a win in the Football League has not changed home
      advantage, but its effect has been greatly reduced in the GM Vauxhall Conference 
      where an away win gains more points than a home win. The statistical evidence
      suggests that crowd support and travel fatigue contribute less to home advantage 
      in soccer than do the less easily quantifiable benefits of familiarity with
      conditions when playing at home. Further possible explanations for the advantage 
      are discussed in the light of findings in other sports.
