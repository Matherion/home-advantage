The aim of the study was to explore the cognitions of professional soccer coaches and players to ascertain their perceived reasons for why teams perform consistently better at home than away. A purposeful sample consisting of three male professional soccer players and six male professional soccer managers participated in semi-structured interviews. Framework analysis was employed to investigate consistency with Carron, Loughead and Bray's revision of Courneya and Carron's original conceptual home advantage framework. The results indicate that key stakeholders' views are in keeping with the framework, though both players and managers place a greater emphasis on the impact of the referee. These findings offer a number of insights into implications for behaviour and suggest avenues for further research.

This present study further considers the prevalence in the English Football Premiership, a division created from the former Football Association First Division in 1992. Archived data were obtained for the First Division seasons 1984-5 to 1991-2 from the Football Statistics Archive and for the English Football Premiership (1992-3 to 2002-3). Chi square analysis confirmed home advantage from season to season since 1984 (p<.05). Analysis of variance compared Pollard's findings and data for the English Football Premiership (1992-2003), as well as the intervening period (1984-92). Home advantage was significantly lower in these more recent periods. Possible factors contributing to the apparent decline in home advantage were highlighted.

From 1980-81, teams were awarded 2 points for a win. This was increased to 3 points starting in 1995-1996. Lower home advantage was expected with the 3-point system as a consequence of encouraging more attacking play from away teams. The results of an analysis of 20,992 games showed no significant differences in home advantage values between the First Division (66.3% before and 62.1% after the 3-point system) and the Second Division (65.6% before and 59.5% after). Nevertheless, there was a significant decrease in home advantage in both the First and Second Divisions after the introduction of the 3-point system.

Design: We present a novel Bayesian network model for assessing referee bias with respect to fouls and penalty kicks awarded. The model is applied to the 2011-12 English Premier League season. Method: Unlike previous studies, the model takes into consideration explanatory factors which, if ignored, can lead to biased assessments of referee bias. For example, a team may be awarded more penalties simply because it attacks more, not because referees are biased in its favour. Hence, we incorporate causal factors such as possession, time spent in the opposition penalty box, etc. prior to estimating the degree of penalty kicks bias. Results: We found fairly strong referee bias, based on penalty kicks awarded, in favour of certain teams when playing at home. Specifically, the two teams (Manchester City and Manchester United) who finished first and second appear to have benefited from bias that cannot be fully justified by the explanatory factors. Conversely Arsenal, a team of similar popularity and wealth and who finished third, benefited least of all 20 teams from referee bias at home with respect to penalty kicks awarded. Conclusions: Among our conclusions are that, in contrast to many previous studies, being the home team does not in itself result in positive referee bias. More importantly, the model is able to explain significant discrepancies of penalty kicks bias into non-significant after accounting for the explanatory factors.

Retrospective data analysis was applied to all games involving WC vs EC teams playing on Monday Night Football with start times of 9:00 pm Eastern Standard Time from the 1970–94 seasons. Logistic regression analysis of win–loss records relative to point spreads and home-field advantage was examined. WC teams win more often and by more points per game than EC teams. WC teams performed significantly better than was predicted by the Las Vegas odds (the point spread). This apparent advantage enhances home-field advantage for WC teams and essentially eliminates the beneficial effects of home-field advantage for EC teams during Monday Night Football games.

This article analyses home advantage in the women's domestic football leagues of Europe and makes a comparison with the corresponding men's football leagues. A total of 47,042 games were included. From 2004 to 2010, home advantage existed in the domestic women's soccer leagues of all 26 European countries analysed, ranging from 51.0% to 58.8% and averaging 54.2%. In every country, this was less than the corresponding men's home advantage which averaged 60.0%. Crowd effects, both on players and referees, and different gender perceptions of territorial protection are plausible reasons for the differences found. Using a regression model that controlled for the competitive balance of each league, as well as for crowd size, the Gender Gap Index, which quantifies the status of women in each country, was a significant predictor of the difference between men's and women's home advantage. As the status of women becomes closer to that of men within a country, the difference in home advantage is less between the men's and women's football leagues.

Data for five seasons (2005–2006 to 2009–2010) were obtained, totaling 9,472 games. The results confirmed the existence of home advantage in all nine sports. There was a statistically significant difference between the sports; home advantage was highest in rugby (67.0%), and lowest in volleyball (55.7%), water polo (56.2%), and roller hockey (58.3%). The design of the study controlled for some of the likely causes of home advantage, and the results suggested that the high home advantage for rugby was likely a reflection of the continuous, aggressive, and intense nature of the sport.

Quantified as the number of competition points won by the home team that was expressed as a percentage of all points gained in the league, the advantage was present in all continents, but showed considerable variation between countries. It was by far the highest in Nigeria (86.82%), followed by Bosnia-Herzegovina, Guatemala, Indonesia, Algeria, Bolivia and Ghana, all between 70% and 80%. Regionally, there were pockets of high home advantage in the Andes, the Balkans, West Africa and Central America, while in the Baltic republics and in most of the Arabian Peninsula it was low. A multivariate model was developed by using proxy variables for the main explanations of home advantage and its worldwide variation. After controlling for the competitive balance in each league, significant predictors of home advantage were: Fédération Internationale de Football Association ranking (a proxy for crowd support), the maximum geographical distance between teams, the majority of teams coming from a single city, at least two teams playing at a high altitude, the recent occurrence of a civil war and the Corruption Perception Index. The model accounted for 43% of the variability in home advantage, the rest of which needs to be investigated after developing more precise measures for territoriality, the ethnic and cultural factors involved and the potential for referee bias.

However, the psychological processes that mediate crowd noise influence and its contribution to the home advantage are still unclear. We propose that crowd noise correlates with the criteria referees have to judge. As crowd noise is a valid cue, referee decisions are strongly influenced by crowd noise. Yet, when audiences are not impartial, a home advantage arises. Using soccer as an exemplar, we show the relevance of this influence in predicting outcomes of real games via a database analysis. Then we experimentally demonstrate the influence of crowd noise on referees’ yellow cards decisions in soccer. Finally, we discuss why the focus on referee decisions is useful, and how more experimental research could benefit investigations of the home advantage.

More than 1 day between games increased the home team's score by 1.1 points and the visitor's by 1.6 points. Peak performance occurred with 3 days between games. The negative effects of little time between games may be due to lack of time for physical recovery, rather than any effects of circadian rhythm (jet lag). Findings suggest circadian rhythm effects in a subanalysis of games on either coast in which the visitor traveled across the country, while the home team did not travel. In these games, the visiting team did 4 points better when they traveled west to east rather than east to west, almost nullifying the home-court advantage. This effect, like similar findings for Monday Night Football games, may be due to West Coast visitors playing night games at an earlier time according to their 'internal clock.'

Overall, a significantly higher number of yellow cards were awarded against the away team, while a non-linear relationship between crowd size and yellow cards was observed. In general, the probability of a yellow card being awarded against the home team decreased as crowd size increased, but was attenuated for the largest crowd sizes. Crowd size may be related to the probability of the home team receiving a yellow card in two potential ways. Crowd noise may be a decision-making heuristic whereby the likelihood that an incident is a foul is increased when accompanied by crowd noise. Alternatively, referees may seek to appease the crowd and are more likely to do so as crowd size increases. The present findings have implications for the training of match officials and for coaches and players as they prepare to play away from home.

The worldwide appeal of sports such as football has led economists and psychologists to devote an increasing body of research to this global phenomenon (Kocher and Sutter 2010). Recently, there has also been a dramatic increase in research examining sport from an evolutionary perspective. This chapter describes research into evolutionary aspects of human behavior in sports, illustrating how evolutionary insights have been applied and have enriched our understanding of human sports and competition, and points to promising ideas for further study. We focus on four issues that have received recent attention. First, we describe the relationship between testosterone levels and sporting outcomes and how they play an important role in the phenomenon of home advantage. Second, we explore the issue of home advantage and its psychological and hormonal mediators in more detail.

Altogether, 461 fans from clubs which had been promoted, relegated or unchanged in the past season of the English football leagues rated crowd support as significantly more influential than familiarity, travel, territoriality and referee bias in contributing to the home advantage. Fans felt responsible for inspiring their team to victory, took credit for distracting opponents, and believed that they could influence officials into making decisions in their team's favour. However, they did not accept personal blame for poor results. No effects for gender, age or the team's outcome in the promotion/relegation battle emerged, though season ticket holders were more extreme in their feelings of responsibility overall. Furthermore, it was suggested that mechanisms such as the perception of being superior to rivals can encourage fans to retain their allegiance to their teams, even when outcomes are disappointing. Indeed, affiliation may become so incorporated into self-identity that supporters may not have the option of abandoning their team, but instead perceive a reciprocal relationship in which both they and the team are expected to do their best to achieve success.

The analysis also examined whether the magnitude of HA is influenced by the crowd size or the relative importance of the match. Thirty seasons of archival data (1978/79-2007/08) regarding home results, away results and corresponding crowd attendance was gathered for every club in the top four English professional football leagues. HA was calculated as the number of home points gained throughout the season expressed as a percentage of all points gained whether home and away. Therefore a HA value of greater than 50% would indicate a more points gained at home whereas a HA value of less than 50% would indicate more points gained away. HA was confirmed for all four divisions (mean 61.7, s = 0.3%) but there was no difference between the divisions in the magnitude of HA (F3,116 = 0.3, P > 0.05) despite differences in crowd size (F3,87 = 226, P < 0.0001). The magnitude of HA was no different between high-stake large-crowd play-offs matches and corresponding league fixtures (t₂₁ = −0.3, P > 0.05). Home advantage is evident in English professional soccer but the apparently complex underlying causes are not very well understood. The magnitude of HA does not appear to be influenced by crowd size or match importance.

Unadjusted home advantage did not vary significantly between continents. However, controlling for differences in crowd size produced highly significant (p < 0.001) variation, with crowd adjusted home advantage - in terms of the percentage of goals scored by home teams - ranging from 56% in Europe to 67% in North America. For all continents combined, home advantage increased by 1.5% per each 10% increase in crowd size (p < 0.001). The effect of crowd size on home advantage in North America was twice that in other continents (p = 0.03).

Design: A paired design was used wherein each match contributed two observations, one for the home team and one for the away team. Methods: The data used in this study were all matches from the first seven seasons (2005/06–2011/12) of the Australian A-League–the major soccer league in Australia. Repeated measures Poisson regression analysis was used to investigate the effect that crowd size and density, distance and direction travelled by away teams, and crossing time zones may have on HA. Results: HA in terms of the percentage of competition points gained by home teams in the A-League averaged 58% over the study period.

Previous findings regarding the role of territorial protection were strengthened by the fact that home advantage was above average for the team from Xanthi (P =0.015), while lower for teams from the capital city Athens (P =0.008). There were differences between home and away teams in the incidence of most of the 13 within-game match variables, but associated effect sizes were only moderate. In contrast, outcome ratios derived from these variables, and measuring shot success, had negligible effect sizes. This supported a previous finding that home and away teams differed in the incidence of on-the-ball behaviours, but not in their outcomes. By far the most important predictor of home advantage, as measured by goal difference, was the difference between home and away teams in terms of kicked shots from inside the penalty area. Other types of shots had little effect on the final score. The absence of a running track between spectators and the playing field was also a significant predictor of goal difference, worth an average of 0.102 goals per game to the home team.

There is also some evidence for home advantage in some individual sports, but there is a much more limited literature. This paper addresses the issue of home advantage in speed skating. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to identify home advantage, because skaters vary in their abilities and the conditions of tournaments vary. There is a small but significant home advantage using a generalized linear mixed model, with random effects for skaters and fixed effects for skating rinks and seasons. Even though the home advantage effect exists, it is very small when compared to variation in skating times due to differences of rinks and individual abilities.

The purpose of the current study was to identify whether the decline in HA in English and Scottish Professional Football Leagues is mirrored by the radical transformation in the training of referees post-WW2, thus providing a new insight into the cause of HA. Design: A longitudinal quasi-experimental design. Methods: HA was calculated for each team at the end of every season for the four English and the Scottish Premier League post-WW2. We also compiled a list of events, statements and quotations to illustrate the dramatic change in the way referees have been trained (physically and psychologically), and assessed over the same period. Results: We observed a systematic decline in HA in professional English and Scottish leagues post-WW2, but with the steepest decline observed in lower divisions with smaller crowds. Of the factors thought to influence HA, crowd support appears the most consistent with these observations. Crowds are known to influence referees’ decisions to favour the home side. However we argue that improved training of referees since WW2 has contributed to an improved ability to make objective decisions and a greater resilience to crowd influence, which explains the decline in HA but also accounts for the steeper decline observed with smaller crowds. Conclusions: The continued existence of HA, and the less steep decline observed in top leagues suggests that referees’ judgements are still not immune to the influence of larger crowds.

Despite large differences between individuals, in the first few days at high altitude (e.g. La Paz, 3600 m) some players experience symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) such as headache and disrupted sleep, and their maximum aerobic power (VO2max) is ∼25% reduced while their ventilation, heart rate and blood lactate during submaximal exercise are elevated. Simulated altitude for a few weeks before competition at altitude can be used to attain partial ventilatory acclimation and ameliorated symptoms of AMS. The variety of simulated altitude exposures usually created with enriched nitrogen mixtures of air include resting or exercising for a few hours per day or sleeping ∼8 h/night in hypoxia. Preparation for competition at moderate/high altitude by training at altitude is probably superior to simulated exposure; however, the optimal duration at moderate/ high altitude is unclear. Preparing for 1–2 weeks at moderate/high altitude is a reasonable compromise between the benefits associated with overcoming AMS and partial restoration of VO2max vs the likelihood of detraining.

All the teams (n = 159) of seven national professional basketball leagues were studied (Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Spain, and Turkey) and classified as capital city teams or other teams. The data (n = 7432 games) were gathered for six seasons (2003-2004 to 2008-2009). The results confirmed the existence of a home advantage effect in all seven basketball leagues. There was a significant difference (P < 0.001) between the leagues, with home advantage highest in Romania (65.10%) and Greece (65.02%), and lowest in Turkey (58.12%) and Lithuania (56.13%). The results also show that capital city teams experienced lower home advantage compared with other teams in all seven countries. After controlling for team ability, this was statistically significant for Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Turkey (all P < 0.05), but not for Lithuania, Russia or Spain (all P > 0.10). These results are consistent with previous studies in football, which suggested that teams playing in capital cities in Europe had lower home advantage than those playing elsewhere. Possible reasons for this finding include a diminished sense of being part of a cohesive local community when playing in a capital city, a lower sense of territorial protection and, for the away team, a lessened feeling of unfamiliarity.

In 1982, for the first time the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) increased the number of qualifying teams from 16 to 24 and in 1998 from 24 to 32, thereby decreasing the probability of a home team advantage by chance alone.

Recent research has shown that sports with subjective officiating tend to experience greater home advantage and that referees' decisions can be influenced by crowd noise, but little work has been done to examine whether individual referees vary in their home bias or whether biased decisions contribute to overall home advantage. We develop an ordinal regression model to determine whether various measures of home advantage are affected by the official for the match and by crowd size while controlling for team ability. We examine 5244 English Premier League (EPL) match results involving 50 referees and find that home bias differs between referees. Individual referees give significantly different levels of home advantage, measured as goal differential between the home and away teams, although the significance of this result depends on one referee with a particularly high home advantage (an outlier). Referees vary significantly and robustly in their yellow card and penalty differentials even excluding the outlier. These results confirm that referees are responsible for some of the observed home advantage in the EPL and suggest that home advantage is dependent on the subjective decisions of referees that vary between individuals. We hypothesize that individual referees respond differently to factors such as crowd noise and suggest further research looking at referees' psychological and behavioural responses to biased crowds.

Two studies investigated testosterone and cortisol responses in relation to home and away venues. In an initial study of 18 male elite Premier League academy soccer players (age, 17.47, SD, 64), salivary cortisol levels were monitored in two competitive matches, both at home and away.

To the extent that a sport requires little teamwork it is more like an individual sport, and the home team would be expected to enjoy only a small advantage.

Secondary aims were to explore the consistency of the home advantage over time and the relationship between the home advantage and team ability. Archival data from 7720 matches contested over the first 20 seasons of the English Premier League were analysed. The data show that teams wearing red are more successful than teams wearing other colours, and that teams are more successful in home games than in away games (home advantage index = 0.608). The home advantage has also remained consistent over time (1992/1993-2011/2012) and is greater in low-ability teams (teams with lower league positions) than in high-ability teams. After controlling for team ability, it was found that teams opting for red shirts in their home games did not show a greater home advantage than teams opting for other colour shirts. Two possibilities for this finding are offered: (1) shirt colour is not a contributing factor to team success, or (2) changes in psychological functioning associated with viewing or wearing red stay with team members after the shirt colour has been changed. It is recommended that researchers continue to explore the effect of shirt colour on athlete and team behaviour and further explore how team ability can affect the magnitude of the home-field advantage.

A more controversial question relates to the causes of the home advantage, and much attention has been paid to apportioning the contributions of various mechanisms (see Courneya & Carron, 1992).

The Decision-Specific Reinvestment Scale was developed to identify those individuals susceptible to disrupted decision making under pressure as a result of their tendency to over-involve consciousness in decision making (Decision Reinvestment) or as a result of their tendency to ruminate upon poor decisions made in the past (Decision Rumination). We asked qualified referees to make a series of video-based decisions to examine whether the home team advantage effect was associated with a high or low tendency for Decision Reinvestment or Decision Rumination. We showed that referees categorized as high Decision Ruminators disproportionately made decisions in favour of the home team. The tendency to ruminate upon poor decisions may help explain some of the variance in the home team advantage effect shown by different referees. We conclude that aspects of personality should be considered in the development of training programs designed to improve and standardise football refereeing.

The association between years of experience and any imbalance in refereeing decisions was also addressed. The authors investigated whether the presence or absence of crowd noise might influence 40 qualified referees when assessing various tackles/challenges recorded on videotape. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the effect of crowd noise and years of experience on referees' decisions. The presence of crowd noise had a dramatic effect on the decisions made by referees. Those viewing the challenges with background crowd noise were more uncertain in their decision making and awarded significantly fewer fouls against the home team, compared with those watching in silence. The noise of the crowd influenced referees' decisions to favour the home team. It is suggested that referees' decisions are influenced by the salient nature of crowd noise, the potential use of heuristic strategies, and the need to avoid potential crowd displeasure by making a decision in favour of the home team.

Here, we examine the second leg home advantage, an effect that is discussed in the public domain but which has received very little scientific attention. The second leg home advantage effect occurs when on average teams are more likely to win a two-stage knock-out competition when they play at home in the second leg. That is, both teams have a home advantage but this advantage is significantly greater for the team that plays at home second. Examining data from three different European Cup football competitions spanning 51 years, we show that the second leg home advantage is a real phenomenon. The second leg home team has more than a 50% probability to qualify for the next round in the competition even after controlling for extra time and team ability as possible alternative explanations. The second leg home advantage appears, however, to have decreased significantly over the past decade. Possible reasons for its existence and subsequent decline are presented.

The purpose of the study was to compare the magnitude of the home advantage in the national basketball leagues of Europe. Thirty-five countries were included and the final standings of league tables for the three seasons 2009-10 to 2011-12 analyzed, a total of 17,099 games. The advantage was highest in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, where over 70% of games were won by the home team, well above the mean for all countries (60.7%). After controlling for variations in the competitive balance of each league, as well as for proxy variables representing crowd size and travel distance, home advantage in the 10 Balkan countries was found to be significantly higher than elsewhere (p < 0.001). This Balkan effect added an estimated 5.1 percentage points to the home advantage. The pattern of results was very similar to a prior comparable study for football in Europe (overall average 61%), with a correlation between the football and basketball home advantage values of r = +.516. The explanation suggested for football is likely to apply also to basketball. That is, the effect on players, crowds and referees of an increased sense of territorial protection in Balkan countries due to the long history of conflict in the region, deep ethnic and religious rivalries and mistrust of outsiders, all heightened by the mountainous terrain and the isolation of many locations.

Results showed that the prediction accuracies of the heuristic models were just as good if not better than those based on Bayes' model while using up to 50% less information. The half time result and the home advantage were identified as the most important items of information in soccer. Study 2 compared the predictions of 208 laypersons on the outcome of the soccer world championship in 2002 with those of experts. Results showed that the laypersons produced more accurate predictions than the experts.

Goldstein (1979). The contents of this book must first be regarded as substantial. Of course, as with any anthology, it is uneven in the quality and significance of its chapters. Using the contexts of sports, games, and play, such topics as aggression, achievement, social facilitation, individual differences, collective behavior, creativity, intelligence, and cerebral laterality are among the topics provocatively considered. Principles of social influence are used to explain why the home-field advantage is more significant in basketball than football. The editor is, however, modest in his ambition for this book; he regards these domains of behavior as understudied and recognizes their value as 'vehicles for furthering scientific theory' and hopes primarily to 'raise possibilities for further research.'

Analysis of all Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) recognized 32 games played by the 1998 World Cup teams between January 1, 1987 and the end of the 1998 World Cup (July 12) indicated that all the teams except one had a HA. Game importance did not affect HA.

Its existence and magnitude is well documented in England, but its causes are still not completely understood. In this study, reliable estimates of home advantage are calculated for the domestic leagues of all countries of Europe and South America, as well as a selection of countries from other continents. The results of all games during the last six seasons are used for each of these 72 countries. In Europe, home advantage in the Balkan countries, especially Bosnia and Albania, is much higher than average. It is generally lower than average in northern Europe, from the Baltic republics, through Scandinavia to the British Isles. In South America, home advantage is high in the Andean countries and lower elsewhere, especially in Uruguay. Home advantage is not unusually high or low in any of the countries from other continents. A multiple regression model for the 51 European countries, which included variables for geographical location, crowd effects and travel, accounted for 76.7% of the variability in home advantage. The large geographical variations can be interpreted in terms of territoriality being a contributing factor to home advantage.

However, nearly all studies up to now. particularly those in soccer and the classic American team sports such as ice hockey and basketball, have shown that relations between spectators and performance variables are only slight or even nonexistent. The present study is the first to examine spectators and the home advantage in indoor handball. Outcomes and spectator variables were analyzed in 5,003 matches in the top German national handball league between 1977 and 2000. Results showed a clear home advantage: Over the entire period covered, there were 66.26% home wins (compared with 11.45% draws and 22.29% away wins). Nonetheless, spectator variables such as the number and density of spectators revealed only very low or zero correlations with performance measures (such as the home team points or goal difference). As these explained a maximum of less than 1% of the variance, they did not possess any practical significance at all—when controlling the performance of both teams between the home team points and; (a) the number of spectators; rp = .05: p < .01; N = 4645; (b) spectator density: rp = 0; N = 4645; and (c) the spectator quotient: rp = -.04, P < .01: N = 4645). The present results give further support to a number of earlier empirical studies (Carron et al., 2005; Jones et al. 2007: Strauß, 1999: 2002a) that tend to reject any substantial relationship between spectators and the home advantage.
