AB  - While a considerable amount of archival research has been dedicated to exploring the home advantage, little is known about the beliefs which key agents hold about the phenomenon. The aim of the study was to explore the cognitions of professional soccer coaches and players to ascertain their perceived reasons for why teams perform consistently better at home than away. A purposeful sample consisting of three male professional soccer players and six male professional soccer managers participated in semi-structured interviews. Framework analysis was employed to investigate consistency with Carron, Loughead and Bray's revision of Courneya and Carron's original conceptual home advantage framework. The results indicate that key stakeholders' views are in keeping with the framework, though both players and managers place a greater emphasis on the impact of the referee. These findings offer a number of insights into implications for behaviour and suggest avenues for further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Home advantage has been examined across different sports. Pollard provided evidence of this phenomenon in association football (soccer). This present study further considers the prevalence in the English Football Premiership, a division created from the former Football Association First Division in 1992. Archived data were obtained for the First Division seasons 1984-5 to 1991-2 from the Football Statistics Archive and for the English Football Premiership (1992-3 to 2002-3). Chi square analysis confirmed home advantage from season to season since 1984 (p<.05). Analysis of variance compared Pollard's findings and data for the English Football Premiership (1992-2003), as well as the intervening period (1984-92). Home advantage was significantly lower in these more recent periods. Possible factors contributing to the apparent decline in home advantage were highlighted.

AB  - This study examines the effect of the points system on home advantage in the two top Spanish professional football divisions between the 1980-1981 and 2006-2007 seasons. From 1980-81, teams were awarded 2 points for a win. This was increased to 3 points starting in 1995-1996. Lower home advantage was expected with the 3-point system as a consequence of encouraging more attacking play from away teams. The results of an analysis of 20,992 games showed no significant differences in home advantage values between the First Division (66.3% before and 62.1% after the 3-point system) and the Second Division (65.6% before and 59.5% after). Nevertheless, there was a significant decrease in home advantage in both the First and Second Divisions after the introduction of the 3-point system. The results were compared with two similar studies of professional football in England. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: To assess referee bias with respect to fouls and penalty kicks awarded by taking explanatory factors into consideration. Design: We present a novel Bayesian network model for assessing referee bias with respect to fouls and penalty kicks awarded. The model is applied to the 2011-12 English Premier League season. Method: Unlike previous studies, the model takes into consideration explanatory factors which, if ignored, can lead to biased assessments of referee bias. For example, a team may be awarded more penalties simply because it attacks more, not because referees are biased in its favour. Hence, we incorporate causal factors such as possession, time spent in the opposition penalty box, etc. prior to estimating the degree of penalty kicks bias. Results: We found fairly strong referee bias, based on penalty kicks awarded, in favour of certain teams when playing at home. Specifically, the two teams (Manchester City and Manchester United) who finished first and second appear to have benefited from bias that cannot be fully justified by the explanatory factors. Conversely Arsenal, a team of similar popularity and wealth and who finished third, benefited least of all 20 teams from referee bias at home with respect to penalty kicks awarded. Conclusions: Among our conclusions are that, in contrast to many previous studies, being the home team does not in itself result in positive referee bias. More importantly, the model is able to explain significant discrepancies of penalty kicks bias into non-significant after accounting for the explanatory factors.

AB  - Explored the significance of performing at different circadian times in the National Football League (NFL) over the last 25 seasons. West Coast (WC) NFL teams should have a circadian advantage over East Coast (EC) teams during Monday Night Football games because WC teams are essentially playing closer to the proposed peak athletic performance time of day. Retrospective data analysis was applied to all games involving WC vs EC teams playing on Monday Night Football with start times of 9:00 pm Eastern Standard Time from the 1970–94 seasons. Logistic regression analysis of win–loss records relative to point spreads and home-field advantage was examined. WC teams win more often and by more points per game than EC teams. WC teams performed significantly better than was predicted by the Las Vegas odds (the point spread). This apparent advantage enhances home-field advantage for WC teams and essentially eliminates the beneficial effects of home-field advantage for EC teams during Monday Night Football games. Results support the presence of an enhancement of athletic performance at certain circadian times of the day. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Most research into home advantage is based on men's sports. This article analyses home advantage in the women's domestic football leagues of Europe and makes a comparison with the corresponding men's football leagues. A total of 47,042 games were included. From 2004 to 2010, home advantage existed in the domestic women's soccer leagues of all 26 European countries analysed, ranging from 51.0% to 58.8% and averaging 54.2%. In every country, this was less than the corresponding men's home advantage which averaged 60.0%. Crowd effects, both on players and referees, and different gender perceptions of territorial protection are plausible reasons for the differences found. Using a regression model that controlled for the competitive balance of each league, as well as for crowd size, the Gender Gap Index, which quantifies the status of women in each country, was a significant predictor of the difference between men's and women's home advantage. As the status of women becomes closer to that of men within a country, the difference in home advantage is less between the men's and women's football leagues.

AB  - Home advantage is a well-established phenomenon in many sports. The present study is unique in that it includes different sports analysed in the same country, at the same level of competition, and over the same time period. Nine team sports from Spain were included: baseball, basketball, handball, indoor soccer, roller hockey, rugby, soccer, volleyball, and water polo. Data for five seasons (2005–2006 to 2009–2010) were obtained, totaling 9,472 games. The results confirmed the existence of home advantage in all nine sports. There was a statistically significant difference between the sports; home advantage was highest in rugby (67.0%), and lowest in volleyball (55.7%), water polo (56.2%), and roller hockey (58.3%). The design of the study controlled for some of the likely causes of home advantage, and the results suggested that the high home advantage for rugby was likely a reflection of the continuous, aggressive, and intense nature of the sport.

AB  - Comparison was made of home advantage in 157 national domestic soccer leagues throughout the world for six seasons between 2006 and 2012, a total of 169,752 games. Quantified as the number of competition points won by the home team that was expressed as a percentage of all points gained in the league, the advantage was present in all continents, but showed considerable variation between countries. It was by far the highest in Nigeria (86.82%), followed by Bosnia-Herzegovina, Guatemala, Indonesia, Algeria, Bolivia and Ghana, all between 70% and 80%. Regionally, there were pockets of high home advantage in the Andes, the Balkans, West Africa and Central America, while in the Baltic republics and in most of the Arabian Peninsula it was low. A multivariate model was developed by using proxy variables for the main explanations of home advantage and its worldwide variation. After controlling for the competitive balance in each league, significant predictors of home advantage were: Fédération Internationale de Football Association ranking (a proxy for crowd support), the maximum geographical distance between teams, the majority of teams coming from a single city, at least two teams playing at a high altitude, the recent occurrence of a civil war and the Corruption Perception Index. The model accounted for 43% of the variability in home advantage, the rest of which needs to be investigated after developing more precise measures for territoriality, the ethnic and cultural factors involved and the potential for referee bias.

AB  - The home advantage is one of the best established phenomena in sports, and crowd noise has been suggested as one of its determinants. However, the psychological processes that mediate crowd noise influence and its contribution to the home advantage are still unclear. We propose that crowd noise correlates with the criteria referees have to judge. As crowd noise is a valid cue, referee decisions are strongly influenced by crowd noise. Yet, when audiences are not impartial, a home advantage arises. Using soccer as an exemplar, we show the relevance of this influence in predicting outcomes of real games via a database analysis. Then we experimentally demonstrate the influence of crowd noise on referees’ yellow cards decisions in soccer. Finally, we discuss why the focus on referee decisions is useful, and how more experimental research could benefit investigations of the home advantage.

AB  - This research aims to investigate second leg home advantage in football. UEFA Champions League quarter-finals and semi-finals from 1954-55 season to 2013-14 season were analyzed, adding up to 642 matches and 336 playoffs. A non-parametric binomial contrast was applied to determine the influence of playing at home, while the binary logistic regression was used to show the explanatory proportion of goals after winning the qualifying round following the first confrontation. The main results showed that, in quarter-finals, local teams (second match) passed the qualifying round at higher rates than in semi-finals, in which visiting teams (second match) were classified at higher rates. From a strategic point of view, a better matchup game model and the selection of an alignment more consistent with the order of two-legged ties, will be some of the utilities offered by this work for coaches.

AB  - Studied 8,495 regular season games in the National Basketball Association over 8 seasons (1987–88 through 1994–95) to analyze the effects of travel and rest on athletic performance. It was found that more time between games improved performance, an effect that was constant over time and statistically significant. More than 1 day between games increased the home team's score by 1.1 points and the visitor's by 1.6 points. Peak performance occurred with 3 days between games. The negative effects of little time between games may be due to lack of time for physical recovery, rather than any effects of circadian rhythm (jet lag). Findings suggest circadian rhythm effects in a subanalysis of games on either coast in which the visitor traveled across the country, while the home team did not travel. In these games, the visiting team did 4 points better when they traveled west to east rather than east to west, almost nullifying the home-court advantage. This effect, like similar findings for Monday Night Football games, may be due to West Coast visitors playing night games at an earlier time according to their 'internal clock.'

AB  - Data were collected on the number of first yellow cards awarded during 857 games, over six seasons (1996-2002), played in the Football Association (FA) Cup. Overall, a significantly higher number of yellow cards were awarded against the away team, while a non-linear relationship between crowd size and yellow cards was observed. In general, the probability of a yellow card being awarded against the home team decreased as crowd size increased, but was attenuated for the largest crowd sizes. Crowd size may be related to the probability of the home team receiving a yellow card in two potential ways. Crowd noise may be a decision-making heuristic whereby the likelihood that an incident is a foul is increased when accompanied by crowd noise. Alternatively, referees may seek to appease the crowd and are more likely to do so as crowd size increases. The present findings have implications for the training of match officials and for coaches and players as they prepare to play away from home.

AB  - The aim of this research was to study the effect of scoring first and its relationship with home advantage in professional Spanish football and indoor soccer leagues, in order to analyse the effect of scoring first on game outcome in relation to home advantage, whether home or away team scores first. Each league was first studied individually, and then results were compared between them. For this purpose, two new metrics were introduced: 'home advantage in scoring the first goal' and 'scoring first advantage'. Results showed a significantly lower advantage for local teams to score the first goal than home advantage in both football and indoor soccer leagues. Likewise, advantage in game outcome after scoring the first goal is found in the two leagues, both for local and away teams, with significant differences in favour of teams playing at home and higher values in football than in indoor soccer league. Distinct football and indoor soccer rules and game features must be considered to explain the observed differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Speculation about key factors affecting home advantage still exists. The present study investigated aggressive behavior amongst English Football Premiership (soccer) players and its relation to home advantage. The frequency of aggressive behaviour, identified by the award of a penalty or disciplinary card (yellow for caution or red for dismissal) was analysed over 2000-2003. Chi-square analyses assessed whether a greater frequency of aggressive behavior was performed by teams away from home. In decided matches, teams playing away received significantly more cautions (yellow cards) than home teams. A further analysis of tied matches indicated that away teams received significantly more cautions (yellow cards) than home teams. No significant differences between home and away teams were found for dismissals and penalties awarded. Reasons for these findings are considered.

AB  - Sports are ubiquitous in human cultures and are valued as a form of physical competition (Chick and Loy 2001; Llaurens et al. 2009a). At the same time, watching sport is a pastime that captivates viewers across the world, with major sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup or Olympic Games attracting audiences of hundreds of millions, both as live spectators, and as television, Internet, and radio viewers or listeners. The worldwide appeal of sports such as football has led economists and psychologists to devote an increasing body of research to this global phenomenon (Kocher and Sutter 2010). Recently, there has also been a dramatic increase in research examining sport from an evolutionary perspective. This chapter describes research into evolutionary aspects of human behavior in sports, illustrating how evolutionary insights have been applied and have enriched our understanding of human sports and competition, and points to promising ideas for further study. We focus on four issues that have received recent attention. First, we describe the relationship between testosterone levels and sporting outcomes and how they play an important role in the phenomenon of home advantage. Second, we explore the issue of home advantage and its psychological and hormonal mediators in more detail. Third, we elucidate possible explanations for why left-handedness may be advantageous in physical combats in westernized but also traditional societies. Finally, we describe and assess influences of color on human and animal agonistic behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of facility familiarity on the home advantage. In order to test for facility familiarity, archival data from professional basketball, hockey, and soccer games (n = 1,590) was classified into three blocks. The first block was games immediately prior to the relocation to a new venue; the second block was games immediately after relocating to the new venue; and, the third block was games following a period of relocation. Overall, the results provide little support for facility familiarity as an explanation of the home advantage. However, there was evidence of facility familiarity as an explanation of the home advantage when team quality is introduced as a possible moderator. Specifically, high quality teams suffered after a move from their familiar venue, whereas low quality teams seemed to benefit. Implications for the home advantage are discussed.

Altogether, 461 fans from clubs which had been promoted, relegated or unchanged in the past season of the English football leagues rated crowd support as significantly more influential than familiarity, travel, territoriality and referee bias in contributing to the home advantage. Fans felt responsible for inspiring their team to victory, took credit for distracting opponents, and believed that they could influence officials into making decisions in their team's favour. However, they did not accept personal blame for poor results. No effects for gender, age or the team's outcome in the promotion/relegation battle emerged, though season ticket holders were more extreme in their feelings of responsibility overall. Furthermore, it was suggested that mechanisms such as the perception of being superior to rivals can encourage fans to retain their allegiance to their teams, even when outcomes are disappointing. Indeed, affiliation may become so incorporated into self-identity that supporters may not have the option of abandoning their team, but instead perceive a reciprocal relationship in which both they and the team are expected to do their best to achieve success.

AB  - Once more, the Football World Championship 2006 in Germany will shift public attention to some problems of football that are psychological topics by nature. Among others, these are the supposed advantage of the home team, the error-proneness of referee decisions, and the danger of crowd violence. From an overview of empirical studies on these selected topics, it becomes obvious that especially contributions with a social psychological background allow to draw clear conclusions and provide promising approaches for the solution of these problems. Moreover, it is argued that the world of football presents an ideal field of application for the validation of social psychological theories.

AB  - This analysis reevaluated the existence of home advantage (HA) within English professional soccer using a point-based calculation that included drawn matches. The analysis also examined whether the magnitude of HA is influenced by the crowd size or the relative importance of the match. Thirty seasons of archival data (1978/79-2007/08) regarding home results, away results and corresponding crowd attendance was gathered for every club in the top four English professional football leagues. HA was calculated as the number of home points gained throughout the season expressed as a percentage of all points gained whether home and away. Therefore a HA value of greater than 50% would indicate a more points gained at home whereas a HA value of less than 50% would indicate more points gained away. HA was confirmed for all four divisions (mean 61.7, s = 0.3%) but there was no difference between the divisions in the magnitude of HA (F3,116 = 0.3, P > 0.05) despite differences in crowd size (F3,87 = 226, P < 0.0001). The magnitude of HA was no different between high-stake large-crowd play-offs matches and corresponding league fixtures (t₂₁ = −0.3, P > 0.05). Home advantage is evident in English professional soccer but the apparently complex underlying causes are not very well understood. The magnitude of HA does not appear to be influenced by crowd size or match importance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Home advantage is well documented in a wide range of team sports including association football (soccer). Crowd support appears to play a major role although the mechanisms through which it operates are unclear. Match data from major international club soccer competitions in four confederations of the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) were used to investigate the role crowd size plays in home advantage and how its effect may vary worldwide. Unadjusted home advantage did not vary significantly between continents. However, controlling for differences in crowd size produced highly significant (p < 0.001) variation, with crowd adjusted home advantage - in terms of the percentage of goals scored by home teams - ranging from 56% in Europe to 67% in North America. For all continents combined, home advantage increased by 1.5% per each 10% increase in crowd size (p < 0.001). The effect of crowd size on home advantage in North America was twice that in other continents (p = 0.03). A logarithmic association appears to best describe the effect of crowd size on home advantage in soccer. Directions for future research into home advantage include investigating the effects of other crowd factors such as density and proximity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this study were to quantify the magnitude of home advantage (HA) in Australian soccer and to investigate how home-team crowd support and away-team travel may contribute to it. Design: A paired design was used wherein each match contributed two observations, one for the home team and one for the away team. Methods: The data used in this study were all matches from the first seven seasons (2005/06–2011/12) of the Australian A-League–the major soccer league in Australia. Repeated measures Poisson regression analysis was used to investigate the effect that crowd size and density, distance and direction travelled by away teams, and crossing time zones may have on HA. Results: HA in terms of the percentage of competition points gained by home teams in the A-League averaged 58% over the study period. HA increased significantly with increasing number of time zones crossed by away teams (p < 0.001). HA also appeared to increase with increasing crowd size (p = 0.07) but only up to about 20,000 persons. Crowd density, distance travelled and direction travelled were not independently associated with HA. Conclusions: The present results suggest that in soccer competitions where time zones are crossed, travel effects such as jet lag may play an even greater role in HA than home-team crowd support. Travel management programs aimed at reducing the effects of jet lag could significantly improve away team performance in Australian soccer.

AB  - Home advantage as it relates to team performance at football was examined in Superleague Greece using nine seasons of game-by-game performance data, a total of 2160 matches. After adjusting for team ability and annual fluctuations in home advantage, there were significant differences between teams. Previous findings regarding the role of territorial protection were strengthened by the fact that home advantage was above average for the team from Xanthi (P =0.015), while lower for teams from the capital city Athens (P =0.008). There were differences between home and away teams in the incidence of most of the 13 within-game match variables, but associated effect sizes were only moderate. In contrast, outcome ratios derived from these variables, and measuring shot success, had negligible effect sizes. This supported a previous finding that home and away teams differed in the incidence of on-the-ball behaviours, but not in their outcomes. By far the most important predictor of home advantage, as measured by goal difference, was the difference between home and away teams in terms of kicked shots from inside the penalty area. Other types of shots had little effect on the final score. The absence of a running track between spectators and the playing field was also a significant predictor of goal difference, worth an average of 0.102 goals per game to the home team. Travel distance did not affect home advantage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although the existence of home advantage in soccer is well known, the causes of this advantage are unclear. Previous estimates of the magnitude of home advantage are updated. It is higher than in other sports. In England home advantage is very similar for the top four divisions of play. Below this level, the advantage is reduced but still exists even with very small crowds. It has been in existence since the start of league play in 1888, but has recently fallen to its lowest levels. It varies greatly from country to country in Europe and is highest in the Balkans. An assessment is made of the current evidence for the main factors contributing to home advantage; these include crowd support, referee bias, travel, familiarity, territoriality and other psychological effects. It is likely that home advantage results from a complex inter-relationship between all these factors, a model for which is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In soccer, home teams win about 67% of decided games. The causes for this home advantage are still unresolved. There is a shortage of research on the psychological states of actors involved. In this study, we examined soccer coaches’ expectations, goal setting and tactical decisions in relation to game location. Soccer coaches (N = 297) with different expertise levels participated in an experimental, online management game and were randomly assigned to one of two groups, 'home game (HG)' or 'away game.' Participants received information on the game for which they were asked to make decisions in multiple points. The only differing information between groups was game location. Regardless of expertise, HG coaches had higher expectations to win, set more challenging goals and decided for more offensive and courageous playing tactics. Possible consequences of these findings concerning home advantage in soccer are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Home advantage is a well-documented phenomenon in many sports. Home advantage has been shown to exist for team sports (soccer, hockey, football, baseball, basketball) and for countries organizing sports tournaments like the Olympics and World Cup Soccer. There is also some evidence for home advantage in some individual sports, but there is a much more limited literature. This paper addresses the issue of home advantage in speed skating. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to identify home advantage, because skaters vary in their abilities and the conditions of tournaments vary. There is a small but significant home advantage using a generalized linear mixed model, with random effects for skaters and fixed effects for skating rinks and seasons. Even though the home advantage effect exists, it is very small when compared to variation in skating times due to differences of rinks and individual abilities.

AB  - This study examined whether home advantage occurred in the Six Nations Rugby Union tournament. Data were gathered using the final championship standings from the tournament's inception in 2000 to the recently completed 2007 season. Home advantage for each championship season was defined as the number of points won by teams playing at home, expressed as a percentage of all points gained either at home or away. An analysis of home advantage for each of eight seasons of competition ranged from 53% (2005) to 70% (2006). There was an overall statistically significant home advantage of 61% for 120 matches played in the Six Nations tournament between 2000 and 2007. Also analysed were the percentage of points won at home by each country. Again, evidence supported home advantage amongst all competing nations regardless of the team's quality.

AB  - Home advantage is known to play an important role in the outcome of professional soccer games and to vary considerably worldwide. In the Turkish Super League over the last 12 years, 61.5% of the total points gained have been won by the home team, a figure similar to the worldwide average and to the Premier League in England. It is lower (57.7%) for games played between teams from Istanbul and especially high for games involving teams from cities in the more remote and ethnically distinct parts of Turkey (Van and Diyarbakir). Match performance data show that although home teams in Turkey take 26% more shots at goal than away teams, the success rates for shots do not differ. For fouls and disciplinary cards, home and away teams do not differ significantly in Turkey, a finding that differs from games in England, perhaps due to less referee bias.

AB  - Crowd support appears to play a major role in home advantage (HA) in soccer, although the mechanisms through which it operates are unclear. Match data from ten seasons of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League were used to investigate the roles crowd size, crowd density and crowd proximity play in HA in soccer. Multivariate Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate HA in terms of the percentage of goals scored by home teams, and to quantify the extent to which each crowd factor independently contributes to it. HA increased by 3.3% per each 10% increase in crowd size (p < 0.001), mostly due to away teams scoring fewer goals as crowd size increases. HA was less in stadia with a running track separating the crowd from the playing field (56%) than in those without (60%; p < 0.05). There was no evidence of an independent effect of crowd density on HA. The results suggest that home-team crowd support contributes to HA in soccer mainly through the absolute size of the crowd, and that its influence is exerted mostly by reducing the away team's attacking strength.

AB  - Objectives: Research has identified a decline in home advantage (HA) in a number of professional leagues since World War 2 (WW2). The purpose of the current study was to identify whether the decline in HA in English and Scottish Professional Football Leagues is mirrored by the radical transformation in the training of referees post-WW2, thus providing a new insight into the cause of HA. Design: A longitudinal quasi-experimental design. Methods: HA was calculated for each team at the end of every season for the four English and the Scottish Premier League post-WW2. We also compiled a list of events, statements and quotations to illustrate the dramatic change in the way referees have been trained (physically and psychologically), and assessed over the same period. Results: We observed a systematic decline in HA in professional English and Scottish leagues post-WW2, but with the steepest decline observed in lower divisions with smaller crowds. Of the factors thought to influence HA, crowd support appears the most consistent with these observations. Crowds are known to influence referees’ decisions to favour the home side. However we argue that improved training of referees since WW2 has contributed to an improved ability to make objective decisions and a greater resilience to crowd influence, which explains the decline in HA but also accounts for the steeper decline observed with smaller crowds. Conclusions: The continued existence of HA, and the less steep decline observed in top leagues suggests that referees’ judgements are still not immune to the influence of larger crowds.

AB  - The home advantage has been consistently found in soccer matches, but conclusive evidence of the origin of this home advantage has yet to be identified. One factor often thought to contribute is familiarity with a local facility. The present study examined home advantage in the French professional soccer male championships (20 teams in each Ligue 1 and 2) and explored the influence of soccer ball type on this phenomenon. Whether it is knowing how a soccer ball rolls on a particular grass surface or some other aspect, the home team can react to the situation better if they know from experience what is likely to happen. The results suggest that type of soccer ball may have an influence on home advantage. Confounding factors are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated whether domed stadiums and team quality effect home field advantage (HFA) for individual locations. The points-margin or 'spread' (i.e. home team points minus visiting team points) was calculated for 1,568 professional football home games between 1988 and 1994. Individual team and team quality (season victories) statistics were analyzed using simple linear regression to determine the advantage. On average, the home team outscored the opponent by 2.91 points. The most striking finding was a nearly perfect positive linear relationship among the season victories' mean points-margins. Results indicate evidence that stadiums amplify the effects of HFA, with domed teams averaging a HFA of 3.22 points, while open stadium teams averaged 3.01 points. This study was unable to discern whether team quality or location weighs more heavily in determining HFA. (French abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article examines home advantage (HA) in association football (soccer). HA is the tendency for teams to perform better when playing on their home ground than when playing away. National variations in HA are found to be related to national cultural and social characteristics. HA tends to be elevated in countries with high levels of collectivism and in-group favoritism, and in countries where governance is prone to corruption and where the rule of law is not strictly adhered to. These findings are consistent with the concept of HA as a social phenomenon that derives from the influence of spectators on the match officials. HA is also found to be elevated in countries with diverse terrain, but the effects of culture persist even when diversity of terrain is controlled for. On the other hand, the hypothesis that HA is elevated in the presence of large crowds or potentially violent spectators was not supported. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study explores, in the case of two soccer teams playing against each other twice in a knock out system, whether it is more advantageous to enjoy home advantage in the first game or to play the second game at home. Our data analysis included 398 soccer games (199 played at home and 199 played away): 220 (110 home and 110 away) games played in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League and 178 (89 home and 89 away) games in the UEFA Cup. Multiple chi-square (χ²) analyses indicated that the teams playing the second game at home had a substantially higher chance of advancing to the next round than the teams playing the first game at home. Analysis of variance conducted on the number of goals scored in each of the two games revealed that the average number of goals scored by the home team increased in the second game. It was also found that both effects decreased when the level of competition was higher. We argue that in the first game both teams attempt to achieve the maximum potential, whereas in the second game, goal specificity exists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: The study aimed to address the paucity of research pertaining to perceptions of causes of the home advantage. The views of three key personnel groups in football (soccer) were examined with regard to their perspectives. Design and procedure: Players (n = 94), fans (n = 116) and referees (n = 163) completed a ten-item questionnaire on which they rated the contribution of the most prominent factors known to influence the home advantage. Results: Factor analysis revealed three subscales (officials, player state and home environment) relating to explanations for the home advantage. A MANOVA examining the groups’ ratings for these three subscales found that the fans and player gave higher ratings for the contribution of officials and player state than did referees, while the fans gave higher ratings for the home environment. Conclusion: The present study provides an insight into conceptualisations of the home advantage from the perspectives of different football groups. The relevance of self-enhancement, emanating from motivational and information processing mechanisms, is considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Analysis of ∼100 years of home-and-away South American World Cup matches illustrate that football competition at moderate/high altitude (>2000 m) favors the home team, although this is more than compensated by the likelihood of sea-level teams winning at home against the same opponents who have descended from altitude. Nevertheless, the home team advantage at altitudes above ∼2000m may reflect that traditionally, teams from sea level or low altitude have not spent 1–2 weeks acclimatizing at altitude. Despite large differences between individuals, in the first few days at high altitude (e.g. La Paz, 3600 m) some players experience symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) such as headache and disrupted sleep, and their maximum aerobic power (VO2max) is ∼25% reduced while their ventilation, heart rate and blood lactate during submaximal exercise are elevated. Simulated altitude for a few weeks before competition at altitude can be used to attain partial ventilatory acclimation and ameliorated symptoms of AMS. The variety of simulated altitude exposures usually created with enriched nitrogen mixtures of air include resting or exercising for a few hours per day or sleeping ∼8 h/night in hypoxia. Preparation for competition at moderate/high altitude by training at altitude is probably superior to simulated exposure; however, the optimal duration at moderate/ high altitude is unclear. Preparing for 1–2 weeks at moderate/high altitude is a reasonable compromise between the benefits associated with overcoming AMS and partial restoration of VO2max vs the likelihood of detraining.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the home advantage effect in professional basketball leagues in Europe, especially the differences in home advantage between capital city teams and other teams in each country. All the teams (n = 159) of seven national professional basketball leagues were studied (Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Spain, and Turkey) and classified as capital city teams or other teams. The data (n = 7432 games) were gathered for six seasons (2003-2004 to 2008-2009). The results confirmed the existence of a home advantage effect in all seven basketball leagues. There was a significant difference (P < 0.001) between the leagues, with home advantage highest in Romania (65.10%) and Greece (65.02%), and lowest in Turkey (58.12%) and Lithuania (56.13%). The results also show that capital city teams experienced lower home advantage compared with other teams in all seven countries. After controlling for team ability, this was statistically significant for Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Turkey (all P < 0.05), but not for Lithuania, Russia or Spain (all P > 0.10). These results are consistent with previous studies in football, which suggested that teams playing in capital cities in Europe had lower home advantage than those playing elsewhere. Possible reasons for this finding include a diminished sense of being part of a cohesive local community when playing in a capital city, a lower sense of territorial protection and, for the away team, a lessened feeling of unfamiliarity.

AB  - This study examined the home field advantage in men’s World Cup soccer. A framework explaining a portion of this advantage includes game location factors, such as rule changes. To examine whether changes in rules may alter the home advantage, we focused on the change made to the rules for the men’s World Cup. In 1982, for the first time the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) increased the number of qualifying teams from 16 to 24 and in 1998 from 24 to 32, thereby decreasing the probability of a home team advantage by chance alone. We predicted and found that prior to 1982 more teams playing in their home country made the finals (63.6%) than from 1982 to 2014 (11.1%). The former was significantly different from what would be expected by chance (12.5%), whereas the latter was not significantly different from what would be expected by chance (6.25%). However, travel might also account for this difference. Implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Officiating bias is thought to contribute to home advantage. Recent research has shown that sports with subjective officiating tend to experience greater home advantage and that referees' decisions can be influenced by crowd noise, but little work has been done to examine whether individual referees vary in their home bias or whether biased decisions contribute to overall home advantage. We develop an ordinal regression model to determine whether various measures of home advantage are affected by the official for the match and by crowd size while controlling for team ability. We examine 5244 English Premier League (EPL) match results involving 50 referees and find that home bias differs between referees. Individual referees give significantly different levels of home advantage, measured as goal differential between the home and away teams, although the significance of this result depends on one referee with a particularly high home advantage (an outlier). Referees vary significantly and robustly in their yellow card and penalty differentials even excluding the outlier. These results confirm that referees are responsible for some of the observed home advantage in the EPL and suggest that home advantage is dependent on the subjective decisions of referees that vary between individuals. We hypothesize that individual referees respond differently to factors such as crowd noise and suggest further research looking at referees' psychological and behavioural responses to biased crowds.

AB  - The home advantage is the phenomenon in sports whereby the home team wins more often than the visiting team. The current data show that home crowd support is not a necessary precondition for the home advantage. In soccer games where no audience was present, the home team still had a home advantage. Furthermore, in some same-stadium derbies (games played between 2 teams that share a stadium; e.g., AC Milan vs. Internazionale in soccer), the home team always has more crowd support, but in these games no home advantage existed. Together, these findings suggest that crowd support is not a necessary condition for a home advantage to occur. The phenomenon might thus be much broader than assumed so far.

AB  - The present studies examined the influence of playing venue on psychobiological responses in male soccer players. Many studies have demonstrated the existence of a home advantage, wherein teams perform better at home than away. A recent focus has attempted to explain this advantage from a psychobiological perspective, with studies showing hormonal differences with regard to venue, game outcome, dominance and perceived stress. Two studies investigated testosterone and cortisol responses in relation to home and away venues. In an initial study of 18 male elite Premier League academy soccer players (age, 17.47, SD, 64), salivary cortisol levels were monitored in two competitive matches, both at home and away. Higher post-game cortisol levels were observed at home (p = 0.002), with the team winning all its games. In a second study involving a 12 semi-professional group of players (age, 23.17, SD, 3.8), the same post-game cortisol findings at home were replicated (p = 0.001), with this team losing all its games. No effects were observed for testosterone in either study. The results extend earlier research findings on the complex relationship which surrounds the psychobiological impact on the home advantage. The findings suggest that higher levels of stress are experienced by home players in their home matches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The consistently better performance seen by teams in various sporting contexts when playing at home is referred to as the 'home advantage'. Various explanations have been put forward to account for this robust phenomenon, though none has yet focussed on possible hormonal factors. In an initial study, we showed that salivary testosterone levels in 17 male soccer players (aged 21-35 yrs) were significantly higher before a home game than an away game. In a second study involving a different group of 25 soccer players (aged 16.75-19.33 yrs), this finding was replicated over two home games, two away games, and three training sessions. Perceived rivalry of the opposing team was important as testosterone levels were higher before playing an 'extreme' rival than a 'moderate' rival. Self-reported measures of mood in both studies were not linked to testosterone level. The present results corroborate and extend earlier findings on the relationships between testosterone, territoriality, and dominance in human competitive encounters and further suggest an important role for testosterone in the home advantage seen in various team sports.

AB  - Evaluated a model based on the hypothesis that a supportive audience encourages the home team to play up to potential, while an unsupportive audience has the opposite effect. The model was tested by conducting a content analysis of 56 soccer, ice hockey, and basketball matches shown on Finnish TV between July, 1984 and March, 1986. The content analysis of each match registered the audience's clear reactions, goals, and penalties over a 5-min playing time. Results did not confirm the model. When the audience supported the home team, the team scored more points and made more fouls than the visiting team. At the same time, the home team also scored more points when the audience supported the visiting team. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study explored the effects of short haul air travel within the same country on elite Australian rugby league (RL) players (n = 12) during two away and two home games of elite competition. Physiological tests of handgrip strength and leg power were assessed along with psychological tests and perceptions of leg soreness and tiredness on the day before the game (Time 1 and Time 2) and on game day (Time 3). Game statistics of tackles and metres gained were assessed for the games analysed. Significant differences were found for daily analyses of life demands for athletes (DALDA) worse than normal responses at Time 2 (2.50 ± 3.23 vs. 3.50 ± 3.93; P = 0.04), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) at Time 2 (2.88 ± 1.51 vs. 3.71 ± 1.37; P = 0.011) and leg tiredness at Time 3 (3.38 ± 1.66 vs. 2.35 ± 1.70; P = 0.004) between home and away games. The analysis of game statistics identified that more metres were gained during home games (83.6 ± 49.1 vs. 63.0 ± 30.1; P = 0.02) and more tackles made while playing away (18.4 ± 9.2 vs. 14.3 ± 6.7; P = 0.016). The results suggest that short haul air travel without crossing time zones results in symptoms of travel fatigue but does not appear to negatively impact on elite RL players ability to perform strength and power tasks. Different game tactics (attacking vs. defensive) occurred between home and away games however, it is unclear whether travel fatigue or a home advantage (HA) is associated with this finding.

AB  - Home advantage is smaller in baseball than in other major professional sports for men, specifically football, basketball, or soccer. This paper advances an explanation. It begins by reviewing the main observations to support the view that there is little or no home advantage in individual sports. It then presents the case that home advantage originates in impaired teamwork among the away players. The need for teamwork and the extent of it vary from sport to sport. To the extent that a sport requires little teamwork it is more like an individual sport, and the home team would be expected to enjoy only a small advantage. Interactions among players on the same side (teamwork) are much less common in baseball than in the other sports considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study explored the relationship between teams' home shirt colour and the magnitude of the home advantage in English professional soccer. Secondary aims were to explore the consistency of the home advantage over time and the relationship between the home advantage and team ability. Archival data from 7720 matches contested over the first 20 seasons of the English Premier League were analysed. The data show that teams wearing red are more successful than teams wearing other colours, and that teams are more successful in home games than in away games (home advantage index = 0.608). The home advantage has also remained consistent over time (1992/1993-2011/2012) and is greater in low-ability teams (teams with lower league positions) than in high-ability teams. After controlling for team ability, it was found that teams opting for red shirts in their home games did not show a greater home advantage than teams opting for other colour shirts. Two possibilities for this finding are offered: (1) shirt colour is not a contributing factor to team success, or (2) changes in psychological functioning associated with viewing or wearing red stay with team members after the shirt colour has been changed. It is recommended that researchers continue to explore the effect of shirt colour on athlete and team behaviour and further explore how team ability can affect the magnitude of the home-field advantage.

AB  - Within a sporting domain there appears to be a remarkable consistency in the size and scope of the home advantage, the effect in soccer being worth around 0.5 of a goal per match (Clarke & Norman, 1995). As Schwartz and Barsky (1977) noted, bookmakers take the venue into account when setting odds, and the media frequently mention the venue as a pertinent factor in any result. It is evident, then, that home advantage in team sports is pervasive. A more controversial question relates to the causes of the home advantage, and much attention has been paid to apportioning the contributions of various mechanisms (see Courneya & Carron, 1992). Popular explanations include factors relating to the crowd, referees, familiarity, travel and fatigue. Knowledge of these factors are important because they may impact the psychological and physiological responses of players when required to play away from home.

AB  - Observation suggests that referees significantly contribute to the home team advantage in football. The atmosphere created by the home team fans is thought to be the major contributing factor, but the extent of this influence is dependent on the referee. The Decision-Specific Reinvestment Scale was developed to identify those individuals susceptible to disrupted decision making under pressure as a result of their tendency to over-involve consciousness in decision making (Decision Reinvestment) or as a result of their tendency to ruminate upon poor decisions made in the past (Decision Rumination). We asked qualified referees to make a series of video-based decisions to examine whether the home team advantage effect was associated with a high or low tendency for Decision Reinvestment or Decision Rumination. We showed that referees categorized as high Decision Ruminators disproportionately made decisions in favour of the home team. The tendency to ruminate upon poor decisions may help explain some of the variance in the home team advantage effect shown by different referees. We conclude that aspects of personality should be considered in the development of training programs designed to improve and standardise football refereeing.

AB  - The existence of the home advantage in sport is well known. There is growing evidence that crowd noise plays a crucial part in this phenomenon. Consequently, a quantitative study was undertaken to examine influence of crowd noise upon refereeing decisions in association football (soccer). The association between years of experience and any imbalance in refereeing decisions was also addressed. The authors investigated whether the presence or absence of crowd noise might influence 40 qualified referees when assessing various tackles/challenges recorded on videotape. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the effect of crowd noise and years of experience on referees' decisions. The presence of crowd noise had a dramatic effect on the decisions made by referees. Those viewing the challenges with background crowd noise were more uncertain in their decision making and awarded significantly fewer fouls against the home team, compared with those watching in silence. The noise of the crowd influenced referees' decisions to favour the home team. It is suggested that referees' decisions are influenced by the salient nature of crowd noise, the potential use of heuristic strategies, and the need to avoid potential crowd displeasure by making a decision in favour of the home team.

AB  - The study investigated the variation in psychological skills usage between game location and performers' experience levels. A total of 25 collegiate soccer players retrospectively completed the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS) that examines activation, relaxation, imagery, goal setting, self-talk, automaticity, emotional control, and negative thinking, following eight competitive games (four home and four away). Participants were grouped into Experienced and Less Experienced groups, based on the level of performance at which they typically played. Repeated measures Multivariate Analyses of Variance compared the usage of psychological skills across game location and experience levels and follow-up univariate analyses suggested psychological skills to be employed more frequently at home compared to away, and for experienced individuals to use such skills more than less experienced performers. Explanations as to how the findings relate to Carron and Courneya's (1992) conceptual model of home advantage, future research suggestions and potential implications for the applied practitioner are discussed.

AB  - In this study, we examined the relationship between home and away matches on mood. In addition, the relationships between game location, game outcome, behavioural factors, and mood were investigated among 12 professional English rugby league players competing in the Super League. Participants completed daily diaries for 27 days. The diary consisted of six analogue scales measuring mood (relaxed-tense, energetic-weary, depressed-elated, tired-alert, anxious-calm, cheerful-miserable) as well as behavioural factors and self-rated performance. There were no significant differences in self-reported mood states leading up to home or away matches except for players feeling more tired when playing away. Significant relationships between mood and behaviours (e.g. sleep and eating) and subjective performance were observed. The outcome of the match was found to influence mood, with a defeat resulting in decreased mood. Our results show that game location did not influence mood and therefore does not provide an explanation for the home advantage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Referees have discretion over the addition of extra time at the end of the soccer game to compensate for lost time due to unusual stoppages. This study assesses if referees favor big teams by shortening close games where the big team is ahead and lengthening close games where the big team is behind. The sample comprises all 380 matches in the Spanish La Liga during the 2014–2015 season. The dependent variable was the extra time the referee decides to add to the second half. The independent variables were the score difference, opponent team’s level of play, yellow cards, red cards, player substitutions, average attendance, and fouls committed. Linear regression analysis suggested that the greater the score difference between teams, the less extra time was added by the referee. However, in close games, referees tended to add more time for a higher level team when they were behind and add less time when they were ahead. Red cards and the number of fouls committed increased the extra time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The home advantage is a widely acknowledged sporting phenomenon, especially in association football. Here, we examine the second leg home advantage, an effect that is discussed in the public domain but which has received very little scientific attention. The second leg home advantage effect occurs when on average teams are more likely to win a two-stage knock-out competition when they play at home in the second leg. That is, both teams have a home advantage but this advantage is significantly greater for the team that plays at home second. Examining data from three different European Cup football competitions spanning 51 years, we show that the second leg home advantage is a real phenomenon. The second leg home team has more than a 50% probability to qualify for the next round in the competition even after controlling for extra time and team ability as possible alternative explanations. The second leg home advantage appears, however, to have decreased significantly over the past decade. Possible reasons for its existence and subsequent decline are presented.

AB  - Home advantage is a well established phenomenon in basketball, but little is known about its variability among different countries. The purpose of the study was to compare the magnitude of the home advantage in the national basketball leagues of Europe. Thirty-five countries were included and the final standings of league tables for the three seasons 2009-10 to 2011-12 analyzed, a total of 17,099 games. The advantage was highest in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, where over 70% of games were won by the home team, well above the mean for all countries (60.7%). After controlling for variations in the competitive balance of each league, as well as for proxy variables representing crowd size and travel distance, home advantage in the 10 Balkan countries was found to be significantly higher than elsewhere (p < 0.001). This Balkan effect added an estimated 5.1 percentage points to the home advantage. The pattern of results was very similar to a prior comparable study for football in Europe (overall average 61%), with a correlation between the football and basketball home advantage values of r = +.516. The explanation suggested for football is likely to apply also to basketball. That is, the effect on players, crowds and referees of an increased sense of territorial protection in Balkan countries due to the long history of conflict in the region, deep ethnic and religious rivalries and mistrust of outsiders, all heightened by the mountainous terrain and the isolation of many locations.

AB  - Previous studies comparing real with model-based predictions in the field of sport have shown that human prediction can be modeled quite accurately by heuristic models. Study 1 compared three heuristic and one normative model in terms of how well they predicted game outcomes over two seasons in the premier German soccer league. Results showed that the prediction accuracies of the heuristic models were just as good if not better than those based on Bayes' model while using up to 50% less information. The half time result and the home advantage were identified as the most important items of information in soccer. Study 2 compared the predictions of 208 laypersons on the outcome of the soccer world championship in 2002 with those of experts. Results showed that the laypersons produced more accurate predictions than the experts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the book, Sports, Games, and Play: Social and Psychological Viewpoints edited by Jeffrey H. Goldstein (1979). The contents of this book must first be regarded as substantial. Of course, as with any anthology, it is uneven in the quality and significance of its chapters. Using the contexts of sports, games, and play, such topics as aggression, achievement, social facilitation, individual differences, collective behavior, creativity, intelligence, and cerebral laterality are among the topics provocatively considered. Principles of social influence are used to explain why the home-field advantage is more significant in basketball than football. The editor is, however, modest in his ambition for this book; he regards these domains of behavior as understudied and recognizes their value as 'vehicles for furthering scientific theory' and hopes primarily to 'raise possibilities for further research.'

AB  - A number of situational factors (e.g, familiarity with playing facilities, distance traveled to a game, game importance) have been hypothesized to contribute to the home advantage (HA) effect. To assess the relationship between these factors and HA, and to further test the utility of a new method of calculating HA, data from World Cup Soccer games were examined. Analysis of all Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) recognized 32 games played by the 1998 World Cup teams between January 1, 1987 and the end of the 1998 World Cup (July 12) indicated that all the teams except one had a HA. Game importance did not affect HA. However, the greater the distance a team traveled to a game and the fewer days teams had between games, the worse teams performed These results are compared with previous research, and possible explanations for differences are provided (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Home advantage plays an important part in determining the result of a game of football. Its existence and magnitude is well documented in England, but its causes are still not completely understood. In this study, reliable estimates of home advantage are calculated for the domestic leagues of all countries of Europe and South America, as well as a selection of countries from other continents. The results of all games during the last six seasons are used for each of these 72 countries. In Europe, home advantage in the Balkan countries, especially Bosnia and Albania, is much higher than average. It is generally lower than average in northern Europe, from the Baltic republics, through Scandinavia to the British Isles. In South America, home advantage is high in the Andean countries and lower elsewhere, especially in Uruguay. Home advantage is not unusually high or low in any of the countries from other continents. A multiple regression model for the 51 European countries, which included variables for geographical location, crowd effects and travel, accounted for 76.7% of the variability in home advantage. The large geographical variations can be interpreted in terms of territoriality being a contributing factor to home advantage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - It is frequently assumed that spectators contribute to the home advantage in team sports. However, nearly all studies up to now. particularly those in soccer and the classic American team sports such as ice hockey and basketball, have shown that relations between spectators and performance variables are only slight or even nonexistent. The present study is the first to examine spectators and the home advantage in indoor handball. Outcomes and spectator variables were analyzed in 5,003 matches in the top German national handball league between 1977 and 2000. Results showed a clear home advantage: Over the entire period covered, there were 66.26% home wins (compared with 11.45% draws and 22.29% away wins). Nonetheless, spectator variables such as the number and density of spectators revealed only very low or zero correlations with performance measures (such as the home team points or goal difference). As these explained a maximum of less than 1% of the variance, they did not possess any practical significance at all—when controlling the performance of both teams between the home team points and; (a) the number of spectators; rp = .05: p < .01; N = 4645; (b) spectator density: rp = 0; N = 4645; and (c) the spectator quotient: rp = -.04, P < .01: N = 4645). The present results give further support to a number of earlier empirical studies (Carron et al., 2005; Jones et al. 2007: Strauß, 1999: 2002a) that tend to reject any substantial relationship between spectators and the home advantage.
