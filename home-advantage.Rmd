### Load packages
require('userfriendlyscience');
require('metabefor');
safeRequire('here');
safeRequire('plyr');

### By default hide R code
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE);

### Set path for query hit exports

### Set path for screening

```

## First query run: 2018-05-14

The first query is:

```
("Home advantage" OR "home court advantage" OR "home team advantage" OR "home venue advantage" OR "home field advantage") AND ("soccer" OR "football") NOT ("American Football" NOT "Australian football") 
```

This was run at 2018-05-14 in PubMed (53 hits) and PsycINFO accessed through EbscoHost (63 hits), and exported to csv, RIS (called 'medline' in PubMed) and bibtex (from PsycINFO) formats. The RIS files were then imported in R using `metabefor`.

```{r echo=TRUE}

### Import PsycINFO hits
firstQueryIteration_psycinfo <-
  importRISlike(file.path(queryHitExportPath,
                          "psycinfo-2018-05-14.ris"),
                encoding="native.enc");

### Import PubMed hits
firstQueryIteration_pubmed <-
  importRISlike(file.path(queryHitExportPath,
                          "pubmed-2018-05-14.ris"));

### Merge the two sets of hits
firstQueryIteration <-
  findDuplicateReferences(primaryRefs = firstQueryIteration_psycinfo,
                          secondaryRefs = firstQueryIteration_pubmed,
                          duplicateFieldValue = "dupl",
                          newRecordValue = "PubMed",
                          duplicateValue = "duplicate (both PsycINFO and PubMed)",
                          originalValue = "PsycINFO");

### Generate bibtex keys
firstQueryIteration$output$records <-
  generateBibtexkeys(firstQueryIteration$output$records);

### Add query date identifier to bibtex keys
firstQueryIteration$output$records$bibtexkey <-
  paste0(firstQueryIteration$output$records$bibtexkey,
         "-20180514");

### Export the hits to bibtex for screening in JabRef
sysrevExport(firstQueryIteration,
             filename=file.path(screeningPath,
                                "2018-05-14-screening.bib"),
             screeningType="screening");

```

The merged list of query hits has now been exported to file `2018-05-14-screening.bib` in directory "screening" and can be opened using JabRef, which can be downloaded from https://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html.

## JabRef configuration

When opening a bibliographic library (i.e. a file with the extension `.bib`) in JabRef, it will show the entry table, which is a convenient way to inspect all entries (hits, references, articles, etc) in the library. To prepare JabRef for screening, two settings are important.

First, to change the fields that are visible in the overview table of all references (i.e. the entry table), open the 'Options' drop-down menu and select 'Preferences'. In the preferences dialog, open the 'Entry table columns' section:

![Figure 1: Screenshot of JabRef preferences dialog when the 'Entry table columns' section is opened.](img/jabref--preferences--entry-table-columns.png)

There, the columns shown in the entry table can be edited in the 'Entry table columns' sections. A bit confusingly, this is done by adding *rows* in the table shown in this dialog. Each 'row' in this table represents a column in the entry table.

Note that in bibtex (and therefore JabRef), you can create new fields on the fly. In this case, use field 'screening1' for screening the hits of this first screening iteration: simply add this field name as a 'row' (column) in the entry table. This will show, for every entry, the contents of that field (if it has any).

Second, you need to be able to edit the content in that field. The entry table is very convenient to maintain an overview of the entries in the database, but cannot be used for editing. To edit an entry, double click it in the entry tabel. This opens the entry editor, which has a number of tabs. Each tab shows a number of fields which can then be edited.

These tabs can be configured by setting the 'General fields'. Open the 'Options' drop-down menu and select 'General Fields' to configure which fields are available in the different tabs when opening an entry. 

![Figure 2: Screenshot of JabRef dialog used to set the general fields.](img/jabref--set-general-fields.png)

Add a dedicated field for the reviewing, showing only the title, abstract, and `screening1` fields. This allows you to focus on the relevant information while ignoring irrelevant and potentially biasing information (such as year, journal, and authors). Each row in this text area shows one tab. The first term on each row is the tab's name, followed by a colon (`:`) and then the fields shown in the tab, separated by semicolons (`;`). For example, you could add the following row:

`Screening Round 1:title;abstract;screening1`

## Screening process

For every entry, add the following text in the 'screening' field:

- If it is excluded, add the reason, specifically (these are ordered progressively; i.e. if one of the criteria matches, apply it and move on to the next entry):
    - **`nohome`** if the study does not deal with the home advantage;
    - **`nosoccer`** if the study does not report on data exclusively for soccer (*also* reporting data for other sports is no grounds for exclusion of course)
    - **`nopro`** if the study does not report on data exclusively for professionals (*also* reporting data for amateur soccer is no grounds for exclusion of course)
- If it is included, add **`incl`**, followed by two opening brackets (**`[[`**) and a list of the relevant variables that were included separated by pipes (**`|`**) and terminated by two closing brackets (**`]]`**), such as `incl [[ supporting audience size | distance from home city ]]`

So once JabRef is opened, when screening, make sure that the 'screening1' field is shown in the entry table (i.e. that it is one of the entry table columns), and create one entry editing tab using 'General Fields' that contains the fields `title`, `abstract`, and `screening1`. You can then use this tab for the screening. It is also convenient to show field `dupl` in either the entry table or the screening tab in the entry editor, because for duplicate records (that were identified as such - the algorithm may miss some duplicates of course), that field contains the text `dupl`.

Make sure to save the database with query hits under a different name than "2018-05-14-screening.bib". That is important because file "2018-05-14-screening.bib" will get overwritten if this R Markdown file is executed again.
